Physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain, increasing the size of areas that contribute to balance and coordination, according to\u00a0Health Day news. The changes in the brain may have health implications in the long-term, such as reducing the risk of falling, said the study's author, Dr Urho Kujala, of the University of Jyvaskyla. Scroll down for video Exercise can increase the size of areas of the brain that contribute to balance and coordination, a study found It could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age, he added. Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits, such as lower levels of body fat, reduced heart disease risk factors, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain. They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins, who were all men aged 32 to 36 years. Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found\u00a0regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria -\u00a0structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain. This energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently, effectively keeping it younger, researchers said. In the short term this could reduce mental fatigue and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And building up a large reservoir of mitochondria in the brain could also create a 'buffer' against age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's.", "candidate_sentences": ["Physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain, a study found.", "It increases the size of areas that contribute to balance and coordination.", "Changes in brain may have health implications in the long-term, such as reducing the risk of falling, said the study's author, Dr Urho Kujala, of the University of Jyvaskyla."], "candidate_words": [["Physical", "activity", "can", "increase", "grey", "matter", "in", "the", "brain,", "a", "study", "found."], ["It", "increases", "the", "size", "of", "areas", "that", "contribute", "to", "balance", "and", "coordination."], ["Changes", "in", "brain", "may", "have", "health", "implications", "in", "the", "long-term,", "such", "as", "reducing", "the", "risk", "of", "falling,", "said", "the", "study's", "author,", "Dr", "Urho", "Kujala,", "of", "the", "University", "of", "Jyvaskyla."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name. But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale. One commenter wrote: 'Your [sic] amazing at what you do. Promise has been posting YouTube make-up tutorials for six years now having started her channel in 2009 and now has 2.8 million subscribers.

Mangala joined from Porto in August last year and is contracted to City until June 2019. Eliaquim Mangala (green bib) prepares to come on but he never made it off the Manchester City bench However, striker Glenn Murray succeeded in putting another dent in City\u2019s chances of redeeming themselves after a run of four losses away, when he scored Palace\u2019s first goal.

Jason Puncheon, signed for a comparative pittance of \u00a31.9m, delivered City their final blow with a goal from a finely executed free-kick.

Forget about rampant diabetes, heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country. In about five years, so many young Americans will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. That alarming forecast comes from Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, who is in charge of U.S. Army Recruiting Command. Obesity, he told me, \"is becoming a national security issue.\" I was so taken aback by Batschelet's statement that I felt the need to press him. Come on! Obesity? A national security crisis? The General didn't blink. \"In my view, yes.\" Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, or a lack of education, or too many tattoos. But a full 10% didn't qualify because they were overweight. Before you accuse me of sensationalizing, it's that 10% figure that worries General Batschelet the most. \"The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50%, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army.\" He paused. \"It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.\" The problem is so worrisome for the Army that recruiters have become fitness coaches, like the trainers on the NBC show, \"The Biggest Loser.\" Yes, your tax dollars pay for Army recruiters to play Dolvett Quince or Jillian Michaels to whip could-be recruits into shape with the hope they can diet and exercise their way to become real recruits. If they lose enough weight, they're sent to boot camp. Some make it; many don't. But, General Batschelet told me the Army must try. \"We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,\" he told me. \"We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.\" Except the Army never considered the type of growth it's now contending with. Nowadays \"personal development\" means working on both character and ... girth. The general, along with so many others in this country, is struggling with why so many Americans, despite all the warnings, continue to eat too much and exercise too little. I have a theory. It ain't pretty. But it's got to be true: We just don't care. \"The acceptance of obesity is prevalent,\" according to Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now. \"When you look around you, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. It's seems normal,\" she said. Just look at the numbers: More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese. That's triple the rate from just a generation ago. So, maybe we should face the fact that we've grown comfortable with our girth. It is crystal clear we haven't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who doesn't. Just the other day, Twitter trolls scolded the singer, Pink, for gaining weight. Pink is not remotely fat. Neither is Selena Gomez, haters. Or Britney Spears, hecklers. If 70% of us are overweight in this country, why are there so many willing to fat-shame people who are not remotely obese? Maybe it's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves. Because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial. Dr. Putnam points to one of Kaiser Permanante's medical questionnaires. You know, the paperwork patients are asked to fill out before they see the doctor. There is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to \"opt out of talking about obesity.\" Some patients refuse to step on the scale. \"You want to be sensitive to that patient,\" Putnam told me. \"You don't want to nag. But, doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this.\" CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, agrees with Putnam. \"Perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem,\" he said to me. \"If a person is overweight -- as difficult as it is -- they ought to be told. You know, this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions. We should call them what they really are: a brain injury, not 'getting your bell rung.' In the same vein, we should tell people who are overweight or obese that, clinically, they're 'overweight' or 'obese' and at risk for just about every chronic disease in the book.\" In other words, chubby is not the proper way to describe a person who is obese. Just like \"fat\" is not the proper term for Pink or Selena Gomez. And, yes, semantics matter. According to the CDC, 81% of overweight boys and 71% of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. We've clearly lost our perspective on what's normal when it comes to a healthy weight.

Packages containing heroin and cannabis were cleared from the roof of HMP Altcourse in Liverpool - hurled there from the outside by friends of inmates who missed their intended targets. The hydraulic crane also recovered so-called 'legal highs' as well as 22 phones, three Sim cards and six chargers from the 60ft roof, contained in a total of 14 bubble-wrapped packages. Officers at the jail, privately run by controversial firm G4S, disclosed the haul in an internal document, which dramatically highlights the extent of drug use among the jail's 1,300 inmates. Dave Thompson, director of the Category B prison, said: 'These items were thrown over the prison walls by criminals on the outside and it required a cherry picker and staff to retrieve them from inaccessible rooftops.' Altcourse, the first prison in the UK to be designed and constructed for a private operator, has been criticised for drug-related violence. After a three-day visit last June, chief inspector of prisons Chris Hardwick wrote: 'There have been 38 serious assaults in just four months before the inspection. Gang issues and the availability of drugs, particularly new psychoactive substances [legal highs] were a significant factor in much of the violence.'

When Copeland, who used to play for the New York Knicks, told the man to back off, the suspect allegedly pulled out a knife and plunged it into the athlete's abdomen and elbow. He then turned on Saltare, stabbing her in the breast, buttocks and arm, sources told the Post.

'We were both stabbed,' Saltare can be heard saying. 'We were attacked out of nowhere by a f***ing black civilian. We have nothing to say. We are scared for our lives!' Another woman, Catherine Somani, 23, was also stabbed in the abdomen as she apparently tried to break up the fight,\u00a0WABC reported. She knew the attacker. Murdock, from Brooklyn, was arrested at the scene along with two fellow NBA players, Pero Anti\u0107 and Thabo Sefolosha of the Atlanta Hawks. The players allegedly obstructed the crime scene as police arrived by refusing to get out of the way, according to sources. Authorities recovered a knife from the scene, sources told the New York Daily News. Copeland and his wife were both listed in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital, while Somani was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital. Their injuries are not thought to be life threatening.

'We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured.' The team confirmed that he had suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen. The fight broke out down the street from 1OAK, a popular Chelsea club where celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and Lindsay Lohan have been spotted partying. The couple is believed to have only been inside the club briefly. The Hawks and Pacers are both in New York for basketball games.

He previously played 56 games for the team in his 2012-2013 rookie season. Both Pacers and Knicks fans flocked to social media to wish him a speedy recovery on Wednesday. 'Hope that you and your wife have a speedy recovery,' one fan wrote. 'Once a knick always a knick.'

They host Rangers on Tuesday with Sherwood admitting he does not have the players to grind out results. Victory would move Villa five points clear of the Barclays Premier League drop zone but they will return to the bottom three if QPR, three points behind with a better goal difference, win. And Sherwood underlined the magnitude of the game ahead of the showdown. Tim Sherwood (from left to right), Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey during their time at White Hart Lane Sherwood (right) sits on the bench with Tottenham Hotspur staff Ferdinand (centre) and Ramsey (left) Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor celebrates his goal by saluting Sherwood (right) and Ramsey (centre) 'I think this is the biggest game that a lot of these players have ever played for this football club,' he said, with Villa in 17th. 'This is without doubt the biggest game of the season for Villa and possibly one of the biggest in a number of years. 'This is the biggest (of my managerial career).' But the boss believes he must instil a different mentality into his players as he tries to keep them in the top flight. 'We've got different types of players, you look through QPR's side and they've got a lot of players who are men - with a lot of experience in there,' he said. 'We've got a few men in there - but we've got a lot of pretty much icing-on-the-cake players and I'm trying to get that mentality into them to forget about digging out results. It's not what we're cut out to do. 'I haven't identified many players who can't cope with the pressure, but you don't know until they get out there.' Sherwood is without Alan Hutton, Ashley Westwood and Scott Sinclair while Tom Cleverley, Kieran Richardson and Aly Cissokho are doubts. Sherwood faces his friend and former Tottenham assistant, QPR boss Chris Ramsey, for the first time since they both left Spurs last summer. Sherwood and Ramsey forged their friendship at Tottenham and remain close ahead of their showdown The bond between the two remains strong even if Sherwood is blocking Ramsey's mobile phone calls for now Sherwood hinted that if Ramsey's tenure at Loftus Road ends, then he would ask to bring him to Villa Park Ramsey has admitted his job at Rangers could be under threat if they get relegated and, while he admitted Ramsey may prefer to be a manager, Sherwood left the door open for a reunion at Villa. He added: 'If there was ever an opportunity for me to work with him again I would do that. 'I would have to speak to the club about whether we could find a role for him here. 'Listen, I know I am biased - he has been good for me and I have been good for him. But he is up there with the very best coaches I have ever seen.'

{"id": "4511bb7f000f7781a94fd4ee9acc88b65a984cd6", "article": "John Carver knows only too well that a Tyne-Wear derby can make or break a manager. His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory \u2013 or a loss \u2013 could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that. 'We had a good football match last weekend (2-1 defeat at home to Arsenal) and got nothing for it. At the end of the day, it's all about getting the win.'

The Champions have creaked in recent weeks and England flanker Wood, who claims Saints\u2019 opponents have \u2018smelt blood\u2019, is desperate to re-gather the momentum that was lost following the exodus of key international players during the RBS 6 Nations. Defeats by Clermont and Exeter have done little to restore confidence but the East Midlands side are ready to address their mini-slump and breathe life back into the title push. Northampton flanker Tom Wood is keen for his side to regain their form following some recent poor results The Saints were dumped out of the Champions Cup quarter-finals as Clermont ran riot on their home turf \u2018I don\u2019t think anyone intentionally switches off, but the intensity of a Six Nations camp like that is very difficult to manage,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018Some people think you\u2019re away at a five-star holiday resort but the pressure is real. It\u2019s a couple of per cent across the board. \u2018You might win it and be partying or you might have lost and come back with a lack of confidence. Then the guys who have stayed back in the trenches for Saints feel like the cavalry have arrived. In fact, the guys coming back are equally tired or even more so. It\u2019s a combination of things and it\u2019s difficult to manage. \u2018Now there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel and we\u2019re not far off full strength. It\u2019s the home straight.\u2019 Saturday\u2019s showpiece fixture will be staged at stadiummk, rather than Franklin\u2019s Gardens, and a record attendance is expected at the home of MK Dons. Northampton\u2019s scrummaging pride was dented in the defeat by Exeter and, according to Wood, the players have paid the price with gruelling fitness sessions. \u2018We\u2019ve had to speak a few hard truths and take a good look at ourselves,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018Teams have smelt blood a little bit. The last couple of teams have really got into us and pressured us at the scrum, which is something we pride ourselves on. \u2018When you give them an in, the fear factor goes all of a sudden and the reputation can dwindle quickly. We\u2019ve got to plug that hole if we really want to be title challengers. You don\u2019t win a Premiership without a strong scrum and set piece. Jim Mallinder's side have been boosted by the return of England lock Courtney Lawes \u2018We\u2019ve definitely been knocked off our rhythm but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve played well for a long time. Winning can paper over a lot of problems and mask a lot of issues.\u2019 But Saints\u2019 season is still very much alive. They will almost guarantee a home play-off with victory while, in contrast, Harlequins campaign will be over if they lose to Sale. The west London club also felt the squeeze of the Six Nations and they must win at the AJ Bell Stadium to keep alive their slim hopes of Champions Cup qualification. Harlequins full back Ugo Monye (centre) is hanging up his boots at the end of the season For winger Ugo Monye, who lines up against Mark Cueto this afternoon as both players prepare to hang up their boots, it is the last chance to leave his childhood club with European rugby. \u2018I\u2019m not going to be here next season but I want to finish in the best possible way,\u2019 said Monye. \u2018It\u2019s hard to get your head around 14 years coming to an end, because I\u2019ve been here since I finished school and it\u2019s all I\u2019ve known. I might be locking horns with Mark Cueto, who\u2019s also retiring, this weekend and it will be just as competitive as the first time I faced him.\u2019 GLOUCESTER v NEWCASTLE (SATURDAY: Kingsholm, 3pm) Dan Robson and Billy Burns form a new half-back pairing for the hosts, in a reshuffled side led by Billy Twelvetrees.

Real Madrid travel to the Vicente Calderon for their quarter-final first-leg match on Tuesday, and Ancelotti admits facing Simeone is both an 'honour' and a 'problem'. Speaking at Monday's pre-match press conference, Ancelotti said: 'What can I say about Simeone? Carlo Ancelotti has hailed Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone as one of the best coaches in the world Simeone's Atleti side host rivals Real Madrid in their Champions League quarter-final first leg on Tuesday The Italian boss oversees Los Blancos training at the club's Valdebebas training ground on Monday 'He is a great coach, I like him a lot. He has proved himself, he is one of the best in the world. It\u2019s an honour to face him and also a problem. 'We don\u2019t have an obsession with Atletico, but with reaching the final of the Champions League. Our objective is not to beat Atletico, but to dream of winning the Champions League. 'Every match presents its own problem. Every match has its idea. Every defeat was different. One was due to set-pieces, one for something else, another due to a not very good attitude, like the last one. It\u2019s difficult to say what happened. Ancelotti has a fully fit squad to choose from ahead of the derby Champions League clash Gareth Bale is available for selection once again after missing Madrid's 3-0 victory against Eibar on Saturday The Madrid players seemed in a relaxed mood during their final training session before Tuesday's match Cristiano Ronaldo shares a joke with Brazilian team-mate Marcelo during training 'It\u2019s not that interesting, but we have analysed it and now we have another tie.' The 55-year-old also revealed he has a fully fit squad to choose from on Tuesday evening with Welsh attacker Gareth Bale set to return to the first team after missing Madrid's 3-0 victory against Eibar on Saturday. 'I am lucky to have the whole squad at my disposal. The formation will be the same as always. 'To play well, we will have to use all our weapons: individual quality and attacking directly with pace. 'Bale is fine. I have the whole squad available and they are very fresh. If one doesn\u2019t play, another will. But Bale is at 100 per cent.' \u2018Bale had a fantastic season last time and scored in both finals.

The pundit has claimed his old club would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five. The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea. Newcastle manager John Carver is not happy with recent criticism aimed at his struggling side Carver has been left with a sour taste in his mouth following Michael Owen's recent relegation jibe Michael Owen captained the Newcastle side which was relegated to the Championship in 2009 Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley. But Carver says he does not listen to those who have never tried management, including Owen, who was relegated with Newcastle in 2009. \u2018I could be nasty about Michael because let\u2019s not forget what happened when he was here,\u2019 said Carver. \u2018But listen, I don\u2019t have a problem with anyone having an opinion. Where I have the problem is with people who have never been in this situation - never been in my situation now. \u2018They have never had to sit here and pick a team when you have got so many injuries, suspensions, or dealing with situations on the training ground or something from left field that you think, \"Where\u2019s that come from?\u201d.\u2019 He added: \u2018Let\u2019s not start a war here because I accept that the likes of Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher have played hundreds of Premier League football matches and I haven\u2019t. I understand that. \u2018But sometimes there has to be a little bit of sympathy with the people doing this job. When you have never gone in and put your foot in the water and tested it, then it is a little different. \u2018There are a lot of people out there who don\u2019t do it because they can\u2019t do it. \u2018It\u2019s easy talking with a tactics board and dobbers, but all of a sudden in this position you have to make a decision because your back four is not high enough and someone is causing you problems because of it. If you don\u2019t see that during a game then you have a problem. People don\u2019t see that.\u2019 Carver, though, does have time for the likes of Graeme Souness and Peter Reid, the former managers of Newcastle and Sunderland respectively. \u2018I never listened to Graeme when I was academy director here but what I will say is that he talks an awful lot of sense on the TV,\u2019 said United\u2019s head coach. \u2018And when I see someone like Peter Reid on TV, who has been in this situation and has managed in this region, he understands what it feels like. I respect what he says.\u2019 Newcastle ace Siem de Jong will be included on the substitutes' bench for his side's match against Swansea Meanwhile, Newcastle will include Siem de Jong on the bench for the first time since August. The \u00a36million former Ajax skipper has suffered a torn thigh muscle and collapsed lung this season and has started just one Premier League game. But Carver said: \u2018You can see what a talent Siem is. I remember watching him play against Man City in the Champions League. He scored two at the Etihad and I thought, \u201cWhat a player he is\u201d. \u2018If I see anything like that then I will be delighted. He is a super lad and is a talented footballer. We just have to be patient with him.\u2019 Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs Fans are unhappy at the club's lack of ambition, despite owner Ashley having \u00a334million in the bank", "candidate_sentences": ["Michael Owen said Newcastle would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five.", "Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone.", "The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea.", "John Carver has hit back at the former Newcastle captain."], "candidate_words": [["Michael", "Owen", "said", "Newcastle", "would", "be", "relegated", "if", "there", "were", "10", "games", "left", "to", "play", "instead", "of", "just", "five."], ["Newcastle", "are", "seven", "points", "off", "the", "relegation", "zone."], ["The", "Magpies", "will", "set", "a", "new", "club", "record", "of", "seven", "straight", "Premier", "League", "defeats", "should", "they", "be", "beaten", "at", "home", "by", "Swansea."], ["John", "Carver", "has", "hit", "back", "at", "the", "former", "Newcastle", "captain."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}
{"id": "2beb3c90dd9c2fe8288f352b6b973b5a0b5dd0dc", "article": "(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: \"I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,\" and \"I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here.\" And, finally, \"Lose some weight, baby girl.\" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and \"ugly on the inside\" to a \"sad, self-hating coward.\" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the \"power of the press\" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and \"the return of class\" -- who express views like, \"Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself?

The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. Scroll down for video A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_ While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as\u00a0North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland. The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.' Wasp numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years (left) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country (right) The number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in Scotland in the last five years, data showed, with those in Fife most likely to report a problem", "candidate_sentences": ["Birmingham topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations.", "Five per cent of residents in Newcastle called in pest inspectors last year.", "London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs.", "Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country.", "But rural areas such as North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps."], "candidate_words": [["Birmingham", "topped", "the", "league", "table", "for", "the", "highest", "number", "of", "rat", "exterminations."], ["Five", "per", "cent", "of", "residents", "in", "Newcastle", "called", "in", "pest", "inspectors", "last", "year."], ["London", "Borough", "of", "Southwark", "has", "the", "most", "mice,", "cockroaches", "and", "bed", "bugs."], ["Newcastle", "is", "officially", "the", "most", "pest-infested", "place", "in", "the", "country."], ["But", "rural", "areas", "such", "as", "North", "Lanarkshire", "were", "overrun", "by", "wasps."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

{"id": "646cba2e8b30945a2079ec4c671740d5db5676e2", "article": "(CNN)\"A long, long, time ago...\" Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece \"American Pie.\"  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8\u00bd minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled.  \"Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\"  By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\"   When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of \"American Pie,\" for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel \"On the Road.\" Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when \"American Pie\" topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing \"American Pie\" at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing \"and they were singing\" everybody spontaneously joins in with the \"Bye, Bye\" chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes \"American Pie\" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When \"American Pie\" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like \"Danny Boy\" or \"Streets of Laredo\" or \"Shenandoah,\" it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, \"American Pie\" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret \"American Pie,\" it's fair to surmise that \"the king\" is Elvis Presley, \"Helter Skelter\" refers to the Charles Manson murders, the \"jester on the sidelines in a cast\" is Bob Dylan, and \"Jack Flash\" the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to \"American Pie.\" Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose \"American Pie\" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were \"Over the Rainbow\" (by Harold Arlen and E.Y \"Yip\" Harburg), \"White Christmas \"(by Irving Berlin), \"This Land is Your Land\" (by Woody Guthrie) and \"Respect\" (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, \"American Pie\" is one of the greatest songs ever written.

Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain \u00a338m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just \u00a310m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of \u00a3200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.", "candidate_sentences": ["Sergio Aguero scored his 100th goal for Manchester City in the 89th minute against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.", "The Argentine has scored 100 goals in just 158 appearances for the club.", "Aguero has been linked with a move to Real Madrid and Barcelona.", "But who would want to come to a club without Champions League football?", "The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets."], "candidate_words": [["Sergio", "Aguero", "scored", "his", "100th", "goal", "for", "Manchester", "City", "in", "the", "89th", "minute", "against", "Manchester", "United", "at", "Old", "Trafford", "on", "Sunday."], ["The", "Argentine", "has", "scored", "100", "goals", "in", "just", "158", "appearances", "for", "the", "club."], ["Aguero", "has", "been", "linked", "with", "a", "move", "to", "Real", "Madrid", "and", "Barcelona."], ["But", "who", "would", "want", "to", "come", "to", "a", "club", "without", "Champions", "League", "football?"], ["The", "likes", "of", "Paul", "Pogba", "and", "Raheem", "Sterling", "are", "potential", "targets."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Klopp, 47, announced earlier this week that he would end his seven-year stint at Borussia Dortmund when the current season draws to a close, prompting fresh speculation that he could head for the Premier League. Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past, is not in their sights, but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight. Jurgen Klopp has revealed he will be vacating his role as Borussia Dortmund boss at the end of the season Arsenal vice-captain Per Mertesacker says Klopp would be a top manager in the Premier League Klopp chats with Dortmund defender Erik Durm during a training session in Dortmund on Wednesday He said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge. 'But firstly, I wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements. Sometimes you can underestimate what it's like going straight into a new job. I think you should give him time - and I wish him all the best.' Klopp waves to the fans after Dortmund's Champions League game against Arsenal in November The German boss has enjoyed a huge amount of success at Dortmund and won the Bundesliga title twice But for all that a new challenge lies ahead for Klopp, Mertesacker admits he cannot work out what has gone wrong to prompt his exit from Borussia. He said: 'It is obviously sad news for Borussia Dortmund, [he was] such a passionate successful and passionate manager for them. He was the guy who turned it around at Dortmund. 'The whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge. It is a sad situation. 'But in the summer, it will be a new situation for him. Maybe he is going to go abroad and see how it goes there. 'I would love to see more German managers abroad, because it is obviously a new challenge, to adapt to the culture, the language, the system. Yes, why not? 'It is his decision. He worked really hard and pushed really hard, so even if he said he is not tired, maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries? 'But I am curious what happened to him because he was an outstanding figure in the Bundesliga in the last couple of years and always a title contender. They went to the Champions League final.

Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that\u00a025 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo \u00a0claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from\u00a0Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

Rode was lucky not to be penalised for bringing down Eugen Polanski in the area a minute later but there was no denying the dominance of Bayern, who came close again when Robert Lewandowski scraped the bar at the start of the second-half.

{"id": "eab44594d70745db7cc2e78dbe73f0aeb4b58d96", "article": "They played in grey and duly put in a dull and uninspired performance, these really are dark days for Newcastle United. Still, at least they returned a club record profit of \u00a318.7million last week and retail gain was probably behind the bizarre decision to ditch their black-and-white stripes. But on Sunday they set another record as losers of the last five Tyne-Wear derbies. John Carver looks on as his Newcastle United struggle against rivals Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby Head coach John Carver said before the game he had a secret motivational tactic up his sleeve and would only reveal what it was following victory. Well, we'll never know what he used in a forlorn attempt to rouse his players. But we do know it didn't work. Phil Neville was scathing in his assessment of Newcastle a fortnight ago when he said that their application during the 3-0 defeat at Everton was reminiscent of a set of players with one eye on their summer holidays. Neville was at the Stadium of Light on Sunday and, rather than prove him wrong as a livid Carver promised his men would, they played like a side with their flip-flops on. Carver was in a rage again on Sunday night, but this time it was his players feeling the fury. 'I said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not working hard enough. I was wrong,' he said. Jordi Gomez and Remy Cabella do battle on the Stadium of Light pitch as Sunderland snatch victory 'The performance hurts more than the result. We were second best. It's a funny thing pressure, some players can handle it and some can't. Some of ours perhaps can't after losing five in a row. 'I am absolutely embarrassed to be part of it.' Newcastle's problem is a sad attitude of acceptance that has been allowed to permeate a squad lacking in ability and character. The Magpie mandate is survival and, to that end, their season finished the minute they were more or less assured of as much. Not even a derby can rally this lot. There was one incident in the second half which captured their passive approach. With the play dead, Mike Williamson had to scream at team-mate Daryl Janmaat in a desperate effort to return the ball with some sense of urgency. Sunderland, in contrast, hassled, harried and hounded their opponents. They had won the previous four derbies because they out-worked Newcastle and wanted it more. They won a fifth for exactly the same reasons. Jermain Defoe earns Sunderland all three points with a sensational volley at the Stadium of Light This was billed as 'The Desperation Derby' given the alarming form of the North-East rivals going into the game \u2013 four goals between them in 18 hours with six points taken from a possible 36. But there was only one team desperate to win this. It wasn't until the final 15 minutes that Newcastle drew a save from Costel Pantilimon. But it was too little, too late. Far too little, in fact. These are dispiriting times on Tyneside. The disconnect between supporters, players and hierarchy has never been greater. On full-time, the Toon Army spat as much venom towards their own team as they did the red-and-whites goading them nearby. They had just witnessed a dour display of nothingness, sadly lacking in energy, imagination and pride. Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul can only look on in horror as the striker's effort cruises in There was one shining light amid the darkness. Cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez was starting his first game in 20 months and was by some distance the only player in grey worthy of applause, and that he rightly received. His shirt was soaked near-enough black come the end such was his effort. It failed, however, to inspire his team-mates, one of which, Tim Krul, was criticised by fans on social media when it appeared he congratulated Jermain Defoe for his stunning match-winner shortly before half-time. But to demonise Krul alone would be wrong. The problems at Newcastle run from top to bottom.

In the images, which are featured in Frida Kahlo: The Gis\u00e8le Freund Photographs, the formidable painter is seen at her most relaxed, walking around her house in Mexico. The pictures portray the artist in her garden or languishing in her bed, giving an unparralled insight into her life with many of the pictures taken in the years before her death in 1954. Scroll down for video In the beautiful new pictures by\u00a0Gis\u00e8le Freund the late artist Frida is seen at her most intimate, her she is pictured standing in her garden in Mexico Beautiful Frida poses in her house (left), in one picture she is seen lying in bed surrounded by books (right) Frida, whose real name was Frida Kahlo de Rivera, was a painter who was best known for her self portraits. These images were strong and she has become  a feminist icon for her striking and unapologetic style, her monobrow and signature, colourful outfits inspired by traditional Mexican  costume. The new  photographs were taken by Gis\u00e8le Freund, a German-born French photographer, who had travelled to Mexico in 1950. Having initially only planned to stay for two weeks she ended up staying for two years after becoming friends with Frida and her husband, artist Diego Rivera. Friday looks happy and relaxed here as she reclines on her sofa in a high necked shirt Frida Kahlo and Dr Juan Farill photographed in her home, 1951, they are standing in front of one of Frida's paintings that was done of the pair Frida Kahlo: The Gis\u00e8le Freund Photographs Photographs by Gis\u00e8le Freund Texts by G\u00e9rard de Cortanze, Gis\u00e8le Freund, and Lorraine Audric Published by Abrams Gisele lived with the couple and began taking many photographs of the pair as they went about their daily lives. In the introduction to the book, Cortanze quotes Freund's impressions of Kahlo which she had told to Rauda Jamis who wrote a book about the artist. She is said to have said: 'She was a formidable being, but in great distress \u2026 not only because of the physical pain due to her terrible tram accident but because she was a deeply conflicted being. 'She loved men, but did not turn away from women. She would shower you with gifts large and small, ranging from a charm, a tiny brass ex-voto, or a good luck stone to pre-Columbian pottery, as well as the heavy jewelry that she was crazy about \u2026 'One day she told me: I don't want to live a long time. I am really suffering too much.' Frida spent much of her life in pain after a tram accident in 1925. Then a young woman she suffered serious injuries after the vehicle that she was riding in collided with a trolley car. These included damage to her spinal column, a broken collarbone, broken ribs, a broken pelvis, 11 fractures in her right leg, a crushed and dislocated right foot, and a dislocated shoulder. It was the accident which forced her to focus on her painting and give up a potential career in medicine which she had been studying. Kahlo painted to pass the time while she was stuck in bed during the time following the accident. She passed away at just 47 and it is reported that her marriage to Diego was a tumultuous. It is thought that both of them enjoyed extra-marital affairs with Diego angering his wife when he had a relationship with her sister. They divorced in 1939, however, they were back together again by 1940. For all of Frida's hard work though it wasn't really until after her death that her work began to gain world-wide recognition and over the years her pieces have been displayed around the world. Her unique look has also previously been emulated by many celebrities. The singer Beyonce once dressed up as Frida. Whilst in the artwork for her latest single 'B**** better have my money' she seems to have copied the artist's eyebrows. Some of the photographs show the inside of Frida's house, some of the walls of which were covered in pictures (left) she also kept dolls on her fireplace (right) There were many interesting artefacts in Frida's house including this turtle which was tucked away under a table Frida stands in the grounds of her gardens, her pose striking against the flora and fauna Frida stands in her garden a long shawl drapped elegantly around her shoulders", "candidate_sentences": ["Frida Kahlo: The Gis\u00e8le Freund Photographs is a new book.", "The pictures were taken by a German-born French photographer in 1950.", "She spent two years living with the artist and her husband Diego Rivera.", "Frida was a painter who was best known for her self portraits.", "She died in 1954 at the age of 47 and was a feminist icon."], "candidate_words": [["Frida", "Kahlo:", "The", "Gis\u00e8le", "Freund", "Photographs", "is", "a", "new", "book."], ["The", "pictures", "were", "taken", "by", "a", "German-born", "French", "photographer", "in", "1950."], ["She", "spent", "two", "years", "living", "with", "the", "artist", "and", "her", "husband", "Diego", "Rivera."], ["Frida", "was", "a", "painter", "who", "was", "best", "known", "for", "her", "self", "portraits."], ["She", "died", "in", "1954", "at", "the", "age", "of", "47", "and", "was", "a", "feminist", "icon."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Davis won nine of the final 11 games of the match and broke Bouchard's serve twice in the final set to pull off the upset.

Bouchard was a semi-finalist last year but had struggled in the lead-up to the Charlston green-clay event, losing three of her last five matches to lower-ranked opponents. Davis used precise groundstrokes to keep Bouchard on her heels throughout the second set. Davis broke Bouchard's serve to love to take a 3-1 lead as the 21-year-old Canadian had a double fault, then sailed a forehand long to fall behind. Two games later, Davis hit a backhand to send back Bouchard's 102mph serve for a winner down the left sideline and a 5-1 lead.

The Prime Minister said he will amend the Working Times regulations so for three days people can volunteer or serve as a school governor, and get paid in addition to their 28 days of paid holiday. But business leaders criticised the move as\u00a0heavy-handed government intervention', amid doubts about how the policy would be paid for. Scroll down for video Happy handshake: The Prime Minister met staff and volunteers at the Age UK Day Centre in Plymouth today Prime Minister David Cameron's Big Society good deeds scheme will only affect firms with 250 or more staff The policy will apply to workers at firms with at least 250 staff - an estimated 10 million in the private sector and five million in the public sector. Volunteers would be able to take the time to volunteer in a block or flexibly. Announcing the policy Mr Cameron said: 'This election is about building a better future for our children and grandchildren. The foundation stone of that better future is our economic security. But Conservatives know the society we build on top of that is just as important too. 'This is the clearest demonstration of the Big Society in action - and I'm proud it's a Conservative government that will deliver it.' But Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors (IoD), criticised the announcement, saying the policy did not appear to have been thought through. 'Many, many businesses are already highly engaged in their local community and with charitable causes, and the IoD thoroughly supports them. Passing a law to compel firms to pay their staff to volunteer for charity is hardly in keeping with the spirit of philanthropy. 'Businesses should support their staff if they want to volunteer, but the architects of this idea cannot pretend that forcing firms to give an additional three days of paid leave will do anything other than add costs. Time off for charity work and volunteering is a matter for managers and employees to discuss between themselves, not a target for heavy-handed government intervention. 'This announcement not only undermines the Tory record on reducing business regulation, it also puts additional pressure on public sector employers, and ultimately the taxpayer. Frankly, the essence of volunteering is that it is voluntary. The IoD would welcome proposals to incentivise and make it easier for companies to facilitate volunteering, but it has to be a choice.' Mr Cameron's plan will affect around 15 million workers across Great Britain in private and public sectors Survival expert and Television star Bear Grylls said that he supports Mr Cameron's volunteering scheme The plan was praised by the chairman of BT Mike Rake.\u00a0He said: 'Corporate volunteering is a triple win - a win for the community, a win for individuals doing the volunteering, and a win for companies.' Survival expert and TV star Bear Grylls also lent Mr Cameron his support for the scheme.\u00a0'Any initiative that encourages people to volunteer is good news,' he said. 'All of us struggle to find extra time and that's why to have firm government support that enables millions to volunteer is a huge step forward towards building solid communities all around the UK.' However, just hours after Cameron's announcement, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said companies would not be forced to organise paid time-off for their employees, suggesting the policy would be unworkable. 'Nobody is forcing anybody to volunteer and no one is forcing companies to organise this volunteering if it causes problems to the company,' Mr Pickles told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added there would need to be 'a bit of give and take' with the Prime Minister's plan. The Communities Secretary insisted it would not add to costs in the NHS, with potential gaps having to be filled by extra agency workers. 'We're talking about three days and it would be worked out according to patterns of work and it will be worked out to ensure that it doesn't cause inconvenience to the health service,' he said. The former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said Mr Pickles had given a 'car crash' interview. He tweeted: 'If yesterday's Michael Fallon interview was a car crash, Eric Pickles just caused a motorway pile-up #r4today.' Mr Pickles suggested companies would not be forced to give staff days-off for volunteering under the plan Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott offered his view on Pickles' interview on the Today programme The Labour party raised concerns about the cost of the policy. Shadow minister Lisa Nandy said: 'This is a re-announcement from David Cameron that has unravelled before it's even been made. 'Giving every public servant three extra days off could cost millions of pounds but there's no sense of how it will be paid for. If just half of public sector workers took this up it would be the time equivalent of around 2,000 nurses, 800 police and almost 3,000 teachers.'", "candidate_sentences": ["PM announces plans to give millions of workers three days paid leave a year.", "Scheme will only affect firms with 250 or more staff in the private and public sectors.", "But business leaders have criticised the move as 'heavy-handed government intervention' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said companies would not be forced to organise paid time-off for their employees."], "candidate_words": [["PM", "announces", "plans", "to", "give", "millions", "of", "workers", "three", "days", "paid", "leave", "a", "year."], ["Scheme", "will", "only", "affect", "firms", "with", "250", "or", "more", "staff", "in", "the", "private", "and", "public", "sectors."], ["But", "business", "leaders", "have", "criticised", "the", "move", "as", "'heavy-handed", "government", "intervention'", "Communities", "Secretary", "Eric", "Pickles", "said", "companies", "would", "not", "be", "forced", "to", "organise", "paid", "time-off", "for", "their", "employees."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

After the Tottenham forward posted a video of himself performing a strange jig in front of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, it is not hard to see why. The\u00a0bizarre\u00a0post on Adebayor's official Instagram account emerged on Sunday, just a few days after the Togo international had taken to Twitter to insist he was committed to fighting for his place in the Spurs team. Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October.

Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth later this month, with a rumoured due date of April 25 Mr Waley-Cohen, pictured in 2014, rode to success at Aintree on Friday and in the Grand National Mr Waley-Cohen, who has been a close confidante of the Duchess of Cambridge for years, rode Oscar Time to 15th place in yesterday's Grand National. In 2011 he was invited to the couple's Westminster Abbey wedding.\u00a0And in 2012 Mr Waley-Cohen- whose relatives include Shell Oil founder, the 3rd Viscount Bearsted - made the Duchess guest of honour at his nuptials to party-organiser Bella Ballin. Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to \u00a310,000.

Speaking in the latest issue of\u00a0Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former\u00a0senator\u00a0and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine Short and sweet:\u00a0Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose\u00a0ideology\u00a0revolves around getting 're-elected at all\u00a0costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female\u00a0politicians\u00a0get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There\u2019s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let\u2019s do something about that,' she said. 'Let\u2019s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that\u2019s OK, and if it does look good, that\u2019s OK.'

The next time he spoke with him, more than two months had passed and the younger Jordan was on a German-flagged container ship 200 miles from North Carolina, just rescued from his disabled boat. \"I thought I lost you,\" the relieved father said. Louis Jordan, 37, took his 35-foot sailboat out in late January and hadn't been heard from in 66 days when he was spotted Thursday afternoon by the Houston Express on his ship drifting in the Atlantic Ocean. \"I was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me, and I was grateful to God that my parents were not going to be worried about me,\" Jordan told CNN. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan told CNN. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" The younger Jordan said he took his sailboat out to the Gulf Stream to find some better fishing, when it capsized.  He broke his shoulder when the boat flipped. Because of the injury, Jordan couldn't repair the boat's mast, which had snapped. \"Everything I owned got broken -- all my electronics, my GPS devices,\" Jordan said.  He was dead in the water. Jordan drifted in the Atlantic, rationing food and water until his shoulder healed. He was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, Jordan said, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" he said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned that they were attracted to his laundry that he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jodran came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital at about 7:30 p.m. Jordan was reported missing January 29, a few days after his last contact with his father. Two months of concern poured out in a phone call with his son's rescuers. Frank Jordan thanked the captain of the Houston Express. \"You're a good man, I swear.

Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli, who is of Afghani origin, was snared by a paedophile vigilante group called Letzgo Hunting. Married Adeli, 32, arranged to meet someone he believed to be a young teenage girl after engaging in sexual conversations online and sending an indecent image of himself. Asylum seeker Jafar Adeli who was arrested at a bus station in Leicester after thinking he was going to meet a 14-year-old girl for sex Adeli had been duped by paedophile vigilante group Letzgo Hunting and police were waiting to arrest him when he turned up at the bus station The vigilante group filmed the meeting, which showed Adeli putting his head in his hands when he realised he had been tricked Adeli agreed to pay for 'Amy's' bus fare to make the 13-mile journey from Hinckley, Leicestershire, to Leicester, where they had arranged to meet. When he arrived, he had three condoms in his pocket. But instead of being greeted by a schoolgirl, Adeli was confronted by police who arrested him immediately while the vigilante group filmed his reaction. The video of his arrest on December 10 has been posted on Facebook and viewed more than 10,000 times. In the footage, Adeli is asked to show his identification to police as he looks up at the officer in disbelief. He pauses before telling officers his name. The officer says: 'I am arresting you on arranging and facilitating child sex offences.' Adeli bows his head and puts his hands over his face before he is led away by police. On Wednesday Adeli was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court after he admitted attempting to meet a girl under 16 after grooming her online. 'Amy' was in fact a vigilante named John who was pretending to be a young girl. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, told the court: 'The man, John, acts as a self-appointed paedophile hunter carrying out covert internet investigations, trying to identify and expose those who would prey on children using the internet. 'He and colleagues used to film such confrontations and put them on the internet, but now they've changed their way of handling matters and contact the police when there's been a meeting arranged.' Mr Murphy said the vigilante had set up a bogus online profile in December claiming to belong to a girl called Amy from Hinckley. Within days, Adeli had made contact and the pair started talking online and exchanged texts and images on their mobiles. The court was told that Adeli had thought he had been chatting to a schoolgirl named Amy, when in fact he had been talking to a member of Letzgo Hunting called John Yesterday he was jailed for 27 months at Leicester Crown Court\u00a0after admitting attempting to meet a girl under 16 for grooming Although Amy's profile said she was 18, Mr Murphy said that during the conversations the man who was posing as Amy made it clear that she was in fact 14. Adeli claimed to be 28. During the online chats, 'Amy' said: 'Sorry, you're too old for me.' The prosecutor said Adeli replied: 'I know, but we can be friends and talk.' Mr Murphy added: 'The conversation became sexual, with the defendant leading the way. He asked if she would perform sex acts upon him, suggesting it in the most explicit terms. They made arrangements to meet after two days.' Navinder Sekhon, defending, described the meeting as a 'preparatory offence and not a completed one' and said that Adeli felt 'deep-seated remorse'. Mr Sekhon told the court that Adeli cared for his sick wife and 'wishes to be reunited with her'. Adeli, who has lodged an appeal to remain in the UK, was placed on a ten-year sexual offences prevention order.

He trains Shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy, the record-breaking Jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys' championship and retire. McCoy has not decided yet whether he is riding Shutthefrontdoor in the \u00a31million Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on  April 11, but everything points to him doing so. Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey AP McCoy rides\u00a0Shutthefrontdoor to Grand National success later this month O'Neill told Betfred: 'Shutthefrontdoor is in great form. I could not be happier with him. I would have liked to have got a run into him (before the Grand National) but he had an abscess on his sinus in January/February time which took a while to find out where it was. 'We did think about giving him at run at Cheltenham (at the Festival in March) but decided not to. I think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly I did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he wasn't as well as he is now. He is schooling well and is spot on. 'He is a clean-winded horse, who is not hard to get ready. He was ready to run and win first time out at Carlisle. He is going to Aintree fresh and well. It is all down to AP now if he is going ride him. 'You need to have a good classy horse for the National. Before, you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck, now it is a proper race. Aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class. 'He likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan. If he got luck in running over the first mile, I would ride him myself. 'I don't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - I am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at Stratford or whatever! This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11). 'Holywell will run in the Betfred Bowl (April 9) after a great run (fourth) in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit. He put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home. 'He came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [Wednesday] morning.

But with Valencia visiting the Nou Camp in the midst of a 10-match unbeaten run Enrique has stressed the importance of forgetting Wednesday night's superb 3-1 semi-final first leg win in Paris.

'Mentally we will have no problems because the players know if they are not 100 per cent against Valencia things will get complicated, but physically there are one or two things we have to assess.' Andreas Iniesta is definitely ruled out for Barca after he was forced off early in the second half of the 3-1 win in the French capital with a bruised pelvis. Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo insisted he was impressed but undaunted by Barca's performance over PSG as his side look to pull off a shock win which will strengthen their grip on fourth place. Santo said: 'What we have seen confirms what we already thought. They are a great team with great players. They don't have many weaknesses, but they do have some.' Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti knows his side have plenty of reasons to be wary as they look to keep up the pressure on the leaders with victory over seventh-placed Malaga.

Ancelotti, who is without the injured Karim Benzema, said: 'Malaga played very well against Atletico (last week), performing with a lot of intensity and quality.

{"id": "bc721db319cbdd6924537aeba7efd61619422d49", "article": "They have become one of the most irritating accessories carried by tourists in recent years, but it appears the selfie stick has been a nuisance for three decades. Hiroshi Ueda, a photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company Minolta, claims that he first invented the selfie stick in the 1980s. He said he came up with the idea after struggling to get pictures of himself and his wife together while they were in Europe. Scroll down for video Hiroshi Ueda, holding his extender stick for taking 'selfies' which he patented in 1983 while working for Minolta After having his camera stolen by a child he asked to take their picture in the Louvre Museum in Paris, he dreamed up a solution - an extendable stick with a tripod screw at the end. The 'extender stick', as he called it, was designed for use with new compact cameras that were being developed at the time. Whether taking in a spectacular panorama, visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert; the chances are your view has been ruined by  a selfie stick on at least one occasion. Now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse, because there\u2019s a next-generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone. The contraption lets selfie addicts take photos  of themselves using their iPad, ensuring they can capture the best possible duck pout or cheesy grin in their shots. The supersized stick is available on the website Accessory Geeks for just $23 (\u00a316), suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon. He added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing. Despite being patented in 1983, the extender stick failed to become a success - mainly due to the poor image quality it captured. But that did not stop Mr Ueda from compiling a family album of family 'selfies' using his device. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'The idea of taking a picture of yourself was very new back then. 'The philosophy behind it was that I didn't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - I could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever I liked.' Some 30 years later selfie sticks are now hugely popular - used by narcissists and celebrities everywhere to capture images of themselves in their surroundings. They have become such a menace that many tourist venues, museums, concert venues and stadiums have banned them. Perhaps ironically, Apple - the company that could be blamed for kickstarting the selfie phenomenon by putting a camera on the front of its phones in the first place - has also banned them from its next conference. Mr Ueda used his 'extender stick' to take pictures of himself with his family while on holiday in Europe (above) Modern versions of the extender stick allow a smartphone to be held aloft and use a remote trigger to take the photograph or video. Mr Ueda's patent ran out in 2003, however, so he has not benefited from the recent boom. Instead Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm developed a hand-held extendable selfie stick in the early 2000s, which he called the Quik Pod. While his product has sold well, there are many others available. Mr Ueda said: 'My idea came too early, but that's just one of those things. 'I patented about 300 ideas, so that was just one of them. We call it a 3am invention - it arrived too early.' The idea of selfies, however, is not new. Remote timers and triggers have been available on cameras for decades. A recently unearthed photograph also showed that some early photographers adopted unusual methods to take their own photo - such as using a broom handle to hit the trigger on their camera. Michael Pritchard, Director-General of The Royal Photographic Society, said there is evidence of selfies going back as far as the 1840s. Selfie sticks divide opinion - some people love them and others hate them. But a growing number of venues and attractions have deemed them such a nuisance that they are banning their use. Last month the National Gallery in London became the latest major museum to instruct visitors that the devices were not welcome. It follows bans in galleries in France and America \u2013 including the Palace of Versailles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Organisers of two major US festivals have also made clear what they think of selfie sticks. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds. According to NME , London's O2 Arena and Wembley Arena have also prohibited them, while Rome's Colosseum also do not permit the use of the gadgets.

It depends on which airline rewards program you've chosen, which route you're flying and when you book your ticket, according to a new Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years. The magazine collected statistics comparing award-seat availability for the five biggest U.S. airlines on domestic routes. The top performer was Southwest Airlines, which offered the most award tickets, 11.9 million, and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats. \"The high number of award tickets is directly related to Southwest's unique combination of 'Every Seat is an Award Seat,' no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the U.S. and beyond, making us the largest domestic carrier in the U.S.,\" Southwest spokesperson Thais Conway Hanson told CNN. \"Unlike other carriers, we also don't charge fees for close-in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up.\" At the bottom of the list was JetBlue, which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest U.S. airlines: 892,000 one-way passenger tickets, or 4.5% of its total 19.7 million U.S. seats. (JetBlue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study.) Many JetBlue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year, making it hard to accumulate miles, an airline spokesman told the magazine. By not allowing miles to expire anymore, the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them. Delta Air Lines came in second place with 5.6 million U.S. award seats; United Airlines ranked third with 5 million U.S. award tickets; and American Airlines was fourth with 3.5 million U.S. award seats. What are the world's safest airlines? Remember that award tickets aren't actually free. The cost of miles is built into everything you buy that's earning you miles, and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all. So it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully. On average, nearly 10% of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by Consumer Reports flew on domestic award tickets, but some of them weren't getting the best value for their miles. While many U.S. fliers redeemed miles on American Airlines flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket, Consumer Reports says. Better to use them on American Airlines' route between New York and San Francisco or Delta's route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which are generally more expensive than that Los Angeles-San Francisco route, according to Consumer Reports' calculations. While award-seat availability is important, it may not matter as much as passengers' overall satisfaction with an airline. Southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score (86), followed by JetBlue (85), Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). And don't forget the fees.

Authorities locked down the Suitland, Maryland campus just before 8pm Thursday amid reports that the shooter had barricaded himself somewhere inside after ramming the front gates. However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street. Now police believe the suspect, only described as a man in his 30s or 40s, may even be tied to another shooting that occurred Thursday in the Southeast quadrant of the city. Scroll down for video Critical: A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau was shot and critically wounded outside its headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. Shooter: Heavily armed tactical teams swarmed to the campus amid reports the shooter had barricaded himself inside 'This started and ended in D.C.,' an FBI source told WUSA. The shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once, according to reports. The campus, built in 2006 and employing thousands, was locked down until about 9pm as authorities unsure where the shooter had gone quickly swarmed. According to the Associated Press, the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car. He went to investigate and it cost him his life. Sharp shooters positioned themselves outside the campus as authorities sought to determine where the shooter had fled Reports: Reports from the scene indicated that loud bangs rang out inside the campus around 8pm, but it wasn't immediately clear if they came from guns or, perhaps, from police 'flash-bang' grenades used to disorient suspects The guard died before 10pm after he was taken to a Washington area hospital, NBC reported.

And Martinez claimed referee Michael Oliver should have risen above the appeals from the Swansea faithful and used 'common sense' to rule in favour of Everton.

'You felt the crowd were asking for two or three decisions and it was building up to a decision and unfortunately we were on the receiving end.' Martinez labelled the result 'a real disappointment', after Aaron Lennon's first-half strike had looked set to give the visitors all three points. Jonjo Shelvey tucked away the penalty equaliser in the 69th minute. Martinez added: 'The only criticism is we had a period of 10, 15, 20 minutes where we were too comfortable in the second half and didn't find that final shot or try to score the second goal, but apart from that I do feel the draw doesn't reflect what happened.'

{"id": "23c3719e463500fa5c98de1e7fc61438e7f2d30a", "article": "Lord Janner signed a letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges. Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. The Crown Prosecution Service has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that Janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an April 9 note to Lords authorities. Scroll down for video Controversy: Lord Janner, who will not face child sex charges because he has dementia, with his daughter, rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner Signed: The letter Lord Janner signed on April 9. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013. Last October he took a formal leave of absence from Parliament, allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months\u2019 notice. New rules which came into effect last May provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks. But Janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior Lords official 12 days ago. A House of Lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself, but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his. Simon Danczuk, the Labour politician who exposed the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith\u2019s horrific abuse of boys, said it was not right for Janner to stay in the Lords yet avoid court. \u2018If you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator, then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law,\u2019 he said. \u2018If he has got a leave of absence from the Lords, that implies that he may get well. Why isn\u2019t he retiring? It makes a mockery of it all. He is bringing the House of Lords into disrepute almost single-handedly.\u2019 The Crown Prosecution Service faced widespread criticism after announcing that Janner (pictured) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: \u2018He couldn\u2019t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis. \u2018But if he isn\u2019t compos mentis, there\u2019s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature. How can they say he\u2019s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting Nazi war criminals? \u2018It stinks of the Establishment covering up and ensuring he doesn\u2019t have to take the stand in public. This is a cover-up, there can be no question about it.\u2019 Janner\u2019s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was suspended by Labour after the CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. Allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children\u2019s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. After Beck was jailed, many other politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby. Mr Ashby, 74, who stood down from Parliament in 1997 after being caught up in the Major government\u2019s sleaze scandals, appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday. \u2018Of course I didn\u2019t know anything at the time,\u2019 he said from his home in South-West London. \u2018The man has dementia and should be left alone.\u2019 Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Lord Janner's QC son Prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the Janner case. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Labour peer\u2019s QC son. Neil Moore, who was based at the 23 Essex Street chambers where Daniel Janner works, was consulted by Mrs Saunders before she concluded not to prosecute. Senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about Mr Moore\u2019s involvement in the decision-making process. But a spokesman for the UK\u2019s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that Mr Moore informed her of the connection before any discussions took place. She said Mr Moore was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to Mr Janner for two years. The potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for Mrs Saunders as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision. Last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge Janner. Eleanor Laws QC recommended a \u2018trial of the facts\u2019 in the defendant\u2019s absence to \u2018get to the bottom of the allegations\u2019. A CPS spokesman said: \u2018It is the DPP\u2019s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what the DPP has done.\u2019", "candidate_sentences": ["Lord Janner signed letter saying he wanted to remain a peer on April 9.", "It was a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges.", "The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009.", "He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013."], "candidate_words": [["Lord", "Janner", "signed", "letter", "saying", "he", "wanted", "to", "remain", "a", "peer", "on", "April", "9."], ["It", "was", "a", "week", "before", "he", "was", "ruled", "unfit", "to", "face", "child", "sex", "charges."], ["The", "former", "Labour", "MP,", "86,", "claimed", "more", "than", "\u00a3100,000", "in", "parliamentary", "expenses", "and", "allowances", "in", "the", "four", "years", "after", "he", "was", "diagnosed", "with", "dementia", "in", "2009."], ["He", "has", "not", "attended", "the", "Lords", "since", "detectives", "raided", "his", "North", "London", "home", "in", "December", "2013."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Doaa and Umm, whose names have been changed to conceal their identities, were\u00a0smuggled from Raqqa, in Syria, to southern Turkey after leaving the al-Khansa Brigade earlier this year. The pair said they used to be heavily involved in punishing others who did not obey the group's rules - including giving 60 lashes to those who tried to flee. Scroll down for video Doaa and Umm (above), whose names have been changed to conceal their identities\u00a0have revealed what life was like working for the brutal al-Khansa Brigade In an interview with\u00a0Sky News Doaa, who left after her Saudi Arabian husband blew himself up in a suicide attack, said women also received a 'standard' 40 lashes if they did not wear proper Islamic dress. The 20-year-old, who was paid around \u00a370 a month by the unit, said: 'What upset me most was lashing old women when they weren't wearing the proper clothes.' Umma, 25, was forced to marry a foreign fighter. She said did not see him very much as he was often on the front line. 'Most of the time I would stay at my parents\u2019 house because he wasn't around. He behaved normally, he would come home for two or three days and then go back to fight,' she said, adding that she did not love him. Now the pair, who are living in Turkey illegally, are scared they will be discovered by ISIS fighters who, they believe, are following them. The al-Khansa Brigade operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa. The women revealed they used to be heavily involved in punishing others who did not obey the group's rules - including those who tried to escape. Above, one of the women shows a picture of herself holding a gun The al-Khansa Brigade operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa. Above, other women from the brigade are pictured holding guns It achieved notoriety last year after women who travelled to join the Islamic State's insurgency boasted of joining the police unit. They used social media to brag about doling out savage beatings and lashings, ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of sex slaves are believed to be imprisoned and raped daily. In the brigade's first manifesto, released in February, women are told to live a completely 'sedentary' lifestyle. It adds that their role should be primarily to remain 'hidden and veiled' and at the service of men, who are described as their masters. While it claims not to have been written or approved by ISIS's leadership, it provides a disturbing look at the way women are treated. Last September a Syrian woman agreed to carry a hidden camera to film daily life in Raqqa. Her footage showed several gun-wielding French women who had left their home country to join ISIS (above) The women\u2019s revelations come a day after a shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya was released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the east of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', were lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others were filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded.

Sky Bet Championship side Rovers were eliminated from the competition on Wednesday night by Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool, who booked a semi-final date at Wembley at the second time of asking thanks to Philippe Coutinho's angled 70th-minute finish in an Ewood Park replay. It ended a memorable FA Cup journey for Rovers that had included resounding home victories over Barclays Premier League sides Swansea and Stoke in previous rounds. Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer believes the club should brace themselves for interest in their players The manner in which they dispatched those two, coupled with the fact they frustrated Liverpool for the majority of the 180 minutes, is unlikely to have gone unnoticed by bigger clubs plotting their summer spending. Bowyer is no stranger to staving off interest in his prized assets, having rejected advances for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede in the past two transfer windows, and the Rovers boss expects overtures for more of his men in a few months' time. 'What the players have done is they've put themselves on a platform and shown that they can play in the Premier League,' he said. 'They've got to maintain that over the next six games and show the Premier League big boys. That's obviously the nature of the game that we're in, I'm not going to kid myself. 'It's the nature of business. If you look at all the clubs now, everybody sells. Liverpool sold (Luis) Suarez in the summer. 'You've seen over the two games against Liverpool and in previous games against Swansea and Stoke that we've got some very good young players. They're developing, they're growing and getting some real experience under their belts.' Blackburn strikers Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede have both attrackted in the last two transfer windows Blackburn's owners Venky's have previously adopted a strong stance on possible outgoings, telling Hull and Crystal Palace that Rhodes and Gestede would be remaining in east Lancashire. However, that position may have to soften if Rovers are to bring their mounting debts down as they look to adhere to the Financial Fair Play regulations. Their recent failure to do so caused the Football League to place them under a transfer embargo which Bowyer knows has left him restricted when injuries have hit. 'You always want to keep your players and we want to be in a position to add to it,' he added. 'We've got to try and do as much as we can with this embargo. The embargo's just caught up with us because we haven't been able to bring enough bodies in.' Bowyer shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers ahead of Wednesday's FA Cup replay Indeed, Bowyer's options are so stretched at the minute that he joked he is considering starting goalkeeper Simon Eastwood in attack against Reading this Saturday. The stopper almost produced a moment for the FA Cup annals on Wednesday when, after coming up for a Tommy Spurr long throw, his swivel and shot deep into stoppage time almost beat Simon Mignolet in the Liverpool goal. 'We sent Easty up, more in hope than anything, we didn't know he had that football ability in him to turn and hit it on the spin,' Bowyer admitted.

Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour. 'The woman concerned in this case and her family lived in fear for months. The stress caused by Boente's actions resulted in family members giving up their jobs and selling their homes, while the victim felt she had lost all control of her life. 'With this in mind, I would urge anyone who may be approached in the future by Boente, either online or over the phone, to call us immediately - do not feel sorry for him and do not wait one moment to contact us.'", "candidate_sentences": ["Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013.", "He originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour.", "He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison.", "He even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers' He was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and a phone possession charge and jailed for five years."], "candidate_words": [["Carlos", "Boente,", "33,", "was", "serving", "time", "at", "HMP", "Birmingham", "when", "he", "began", "contacting", "the", "19-year-old", "woman", "in", "November", "2013."], ["He", "originally", "asked", "her", "to", "change", "his", "Facebook", "password", "as", "a", "favour."], ["He", "then", "bombarded", "the", "teen", "with", "thousands", "of", "texts", "and", "calls", "-", "telling", "her", "sob", "stories", "about", "his", "life", "saying", "he", "had", "no", "family", "and", "nobody", "visited", "him", "in", "prison."], ["He", "even", "sent", "three", "men", "to", "the", "home", "of", "the", "woman's", "aunt", "and", "uncle,", "before", "boasting", "on", "Facebook", "the", "gang", "were", "his", "'soldiers'", "He", "was", "found", "guilty", "of", "conspiracy", "to", "burgle,", "harassment", "and", "a", "phone", "possession", "charge", "and", "jailed", "for", "five", "years."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

It is an ominous warning from a man who has won nine of the last 11 grands prix, been on pole at the last four, and who already holds a 27-point cushion in the drivers' standings. It is no wonder after winning in Bahrain, when Hamilton stepped out of his Mercedes, he immediately stood on top of it and pretended to smack an imaginary baseball out of the circuit. Lewis Hamilton stands on his Mercedes after winning the Bahrain\u00a0Grand Prix It was another 'home run' performance from Hamilton, a man who claims he is a perfectionist, and who appears to be driving as close to perfection as can possibly be achieved in the sport. It led to the suggestion that perhaps he was feeling unbeatable, to which he replied: 'I don't know what the feeling of being unbeatable is. 'I know I feel very powerful in this car with the package we have, and I feel I'm able to get everything from it. 'I also feel more comfortable in this car than I did in the one last year, and I feel within myself, with whatever approach I have, the power is greater than ever in terms of strength in the car. 'It's like 'yes'. I put the car there and it goes there, I get the exit. 'Naturally you always feel there are things you can still improve on, but it's hard to always pinpoint what those are and to tell the team what to focus on. Hamilton is congratulated by Ferrari rival Kimi Raikkonen on Sunday 'That's what a team leader has to do, and, along with Nico (Rosberg), I'm trying to guide the team, to tell them where to go next.' So just how close to perfection does Hamilton feel? 'There are always areas. I'll look and think 'Could I have braked later for the pit entry? Could I have done a better outlap?' said the 30-year-old. 'I feel I'm doing the best I can, and I'm learning and improving at the same time, which is all I can ask for.' Yet do not dare to suggest to Hamilton that he does not work as hard off the track in terms of poring over every aspect of what is required to ensure he is at one with his car. In being compared with former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button in the past, or Rosberg at present, the feeling has generally been they are more studious than Hamilton, who simply just drives. 'Of course I analyse. You can't be a world champion without doing that,' Hamilton said. 'I remember speaking about this a long time ago and I don't know if people get a perception as to who you are as a driver, but I work as hard as any other driver. 'Just because I do things differently it doesn't mean I'm worse. Race winner Hamilton celebrates with the trophy on the podium in Bahrain 'There was a point where people said Nico was a doctor of this or that; Jenson was a doctor of his tyres. 'I tick off all the boxes, and I've worked to do that. 'The results I get are not only from my raw ability because I study hard, I work hard to make notes about my tyres, about every single thing I do, which I've done since my days in Formula Three. 'Ultimately, I don't care what people think. I just do the job.' Hamilton certainly has Rosberg scratching his head as the German appears to have run out of ideas as to how to beat his main rival. Hamilton has now set a personal record run of 11 consecutive grands prix in the points - twice finishing second in addition to the nine wins. If you include the double points for the final race of last season, Hamilton has scored an astonishing 286 from a potential 300. It is not perfection, so perhaps there is a feeling of never being quite satisfied. 'That's natural for anyone who has the competitiveness I have,' said Hamilton. 'I know the potential I have, and whether or not I'm living up to it. 'I feel I am coming close to full potential - although who knows exactly what that is - but I do feel quite satisfied.' Which is why he also feels he still has more to give, starting with the next grand prix in three weeks' time in Spain. 'I got the pole, I did the job (in Bahrain),' Hamilton said.

Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team. Stefan de Vrij (right) headed Holland in front against Spain at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday Gerard Pique (left) could do nothing to stop Davy Klaassen doubling the Dutch advantage Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo became the 55th and 56th players to debut under Del Bosque, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea, defenders Raul Albiol, Juan Bernat and Dani Carvajal and midfielder Mario Suarez all started the game. 'The national team's state of health is good,' centre back Gerard Pique told reporters. 'We are in a process where players are coming into the team and gathering experience,' added the Barcelona defender. 'We are second in qualifying (for Euro 2016) and these friendly games are for experimenting. 'I am not that worried about this match because we lost friendlies in previous years and then ended up winning titles.' David de Gea was given a start by Vicente del Bosque but could not keep out De Vrij's header here Dani Carvajal (centre) was another squad player given a chance to impress against Holland Del Bosque will be confident he can find the right mix of players to secure Spain's berth at Euro 2016 in France next year, when they will be chasing an unprecedented third straight title. Slovakia are the surprise leaders in qualifying Group C thanks to a 2-1 win over Spain in Zilina in October and have a maximum 15 points from five of 10 matches.

It was a call to action: Within hours of the first 7.8 magnitude quake, India began planning a massive cross-border aid mission. With each hour, the scale of the devastation in Nepal became clearer -- some 3,862 people are known to have died so far -- and plans in India, where 72 people were also killed, got bigger. On Sunday alone, India delivered 187 tons of supplies, including 50 tons of water, 22 tons of food and 2 tons of medicine. And there will be more to come. Hundreds of trained disaster relief troops landed in Kathmandu and quickly got to work. With each flight in, there was a flight back out, packed with Indians and other nationals escaping to safety: 2,000 and counting have fled so far. By Monday, India was in full-scale crisis mode: From airports across India, planes flew in loaded with aid, and trucks made the trip by land from India's east, aiming for more remote areas. On the ground: Devastation in Nepal India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a special effort over Nepal. He has visited the country twice in his first year in office. And on Sunday, in his national radio address to the nation, he said Indians needed to \"wipe the tears of every Nepali, hold their hands, and stand with them.\" It all highlights the more proactive role taken by India in recent months. Just weeks ago, India flexed its military muscle to rescue Indians and other nationals from conflict-torn Yemen. Now, it is taking the lead in Nepal. Some might say India's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with Nepal: China. A display of hard power, perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region. But in times like this, help is always welcome. First there's the immediate search and rescue operation, and then the long process of rebuilding work.

But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019. Bader \u2013 who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 \u2013 was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader\u2019s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as \u2018the most brilliant escape conception of this war\u2019. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp\u2019s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break \u2013 August 30, 1942 \u2013 the prisoners managed to fuse the camp\u2019s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a \u2018home run\u2019 back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the \u2018escape-proof\u2019 Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader\u2019s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book have been bought by the makers of 2013\u2019s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting. Essential 11 did a fantastic job with Saving Mr Banks and to have that same team working on this is very pleasing.'", "candidate_sentences": ["Douglas Bader was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg.", "It was there that he was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough.", "Bader\u2019s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More.", "This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night."], "candidate_words": [["Douglas", "Bader", "was", "shot", "down", "over", "France", "in", "August", "1941", "and", "ended", "up", "in", "a", "German", "prison", "camp", "in", "Warburg."], ["It", "was", "there", "that", "he", "was", "involved", "in", "a", "mass", "break-out", "that", "pre-dated", "the", "break", "in", "1944", "immortalised", "in", "The", "Great", "Escape", "starring", "Steve", "McQueen", "and", "Richard", "Attenborough."], ["Bader\u2019s", "life", "story", "has", "already", "been", "the", "subject", "of", "the", "successful", "film", "Reach", "for", "the", "Sky", "in", "1956", "starring", "Kenneth", "More."], ["This", "latest", "look", "at", "his", "exploits", "is", "based", "on", "a", "book", "on", "the", "Warburg", "escape", "by", "historian", "Mark", "Felton", "called", "Zero", "Night."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

The bail hearing revealed that Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0suffered blows to her stomach causing severe bowel damage- ultimately leading to her death. The bail hearing revealed Kyesha-Lee succumbed to massive bowel injuries after being struck days before her death Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0was in the care of her father Matthew Lee Williamson and Christopher Arthur Neville Kent who have both been charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. Crown prosecutor Vicki Loury alleged the toddler also suffered a penetrative injury to her vagina three days before her death. She was not seen of or heard of by anyone else in the five days prior to her death, although another man visited the home the night before Kyhesha-Lee\u00a0died. 'She was by that stage in severe distress, extremely unwell,' Ms Loury told the court. Kyhesha-Lee Joughin \u00a0was allegedly locked in a bedroom by her father, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room Kyhesha-Lee's body was found days after she suffered the blows - allegedly in squalid surroundings - at the unit she shared with her father in Petrie, north of Brisbane, on March 30, 2013. Kent, 46, was granted bail in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday after the court heard he'd offered to plead guilty on the basis of criminal negligence. Williamson allegedly locked his daughter in the bedroom while he slept during the day, forcing her to defecate and urinate in the room. Her father Matthew Lee Williamson and his friend Christopher Arthur Neville Kent, who also lived in the house and cared for the child in the days prior to her death, are each charged with manslaughter and child cruelty. They have both been released on bail Evidence of the child's blood had been found on Kent's shorts. 'It was a small unit, he must have been aware of what was happening with the child,' Ms Loury said. Chief Magistrate Ray Rinaudo agreed with Kent's barrister Soraya Ryan that the accused no longer presented a risk of fleeing or re-offending on bail. Kyhesha-Lee's body was found - allegedly in squalid surroundings - at the unit she shared with her father in Petrie, north of Brisbane, on March 30, 2013 Magistrate Rinaudo said he was ultimately swayed by Kent's steps towards taking responsibility for the 'tragic' events by his plea offer.

One traveller in particular knows how wrong a holiday snap can go, after he posted a picture online of him 'missing' the top of the Eiffel Tower and asked users to help improve his photo. On a recent trip to Paris, Belgian food blogger Yves Van De Ven enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clich\u00e9s and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments. Little did he know he would become an internet sensation, after his photo with the Eiffel Tower captioned 'nailed it' was uploaded to photosharing website 4chan. Since then over 100 photoshopped pictures have sprung up comically connecting his finger with the tip of the famous attraction, and it didn't stop there... Nailed it!\u00a0Yves Van De Ven, 37, uploaded this photograph on social media in a bid to poke fun of the typical tourist pictures Going viral! An upload on photo-sharing site 4chan requested users connect his finger with the top of the tower, as many tourist pictures aim to achieve The 37-year-old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks. 'The original pictures in which me and my friends 'nailed it' were an instant hit with my friends as soon as I posted them on Facebook,' Van De Ven said. 'There were people that thought we just took poor pictures but luckily most of my friends know better.' Obviously the internet had something to say about the pictures and after someone uploaded the pictures to 4chan, users from all over the globe submitted their own 'improved' versions of Van De Ven's pictures. Created images ranged from the comical, with the 301m tower bent over to touch his outstretched finger, to the absurd, with Van De Ven imposed into Michaelango's Creation of Adam, reaching out towards the Eiffel Tower. The wondrous offerings demonstrate what a brilliant place the internet is, and how no one's holiday pictures are safe. Bendy tower! The tower appears to have flopped over in the summer heat, making a connection with the food blogger's finger Cut out! Despite covering the 37-year-old, his finger is clearly in contact in this picture! Expert photoshopping creates a miniature tower touching his finger, never mind about the gaping white hole left behind! Close enough! Tilting the tower 45 degrees, and extending his arm in an octopus fashion were methods used to 'improve' the picture Super hero! In a Hulk-like fashion, not only has\u00a0Van De Ven knocked over the Eiffel Tower, but also has it grasped in two fingers Van De Ven is shocked but highly entertained at the widespread response to his holiday pictures. 'I can honestly say that we have had as much fun taking these silly pictures as we have had the week after overviewing the hilarious aftermath. 'Some of the photoshopped pictures are just brilliant.' Eiffel Tower touches\u00a0Van De Ven! This photo plays on role reversal with the tower spectacularly missing touching him Basically there! A longer arm is all it takes to recreate the popular tourist pose If in doubt, enlarge the poser (left), or do as most people do and stand closer to the camera! Or why not create more failed fingers (right) to add to the picture? Why not just duplicate the offending failed finger all over the Eiffel Tower? (Still without it making contact!) See double! That works! Not only does he touch the top, he does it twice in this picture A portal has allowed the tip of the tower to protrude near the blogger's feet so he can touch the tip Why not ignore the failed hand all together, and just reposition it on top?

His survival is unusual, as experts say it's rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster. The man, Rishi Khanal, was saved after a French search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of Kathmandu, the capital, around noon Tuesday, said Pushparam K.C., a spokesman for the Armed Police Force of Nepal. The team used specialized gear that detects signs of life, he said. But it took about 10 more hours for the French team and police officers to dig him out, the spokesman said. A police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach Khanal's location and then hauling him up through the hole. They then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher. On Wednesday afternoon, Khanal, 27, had just undergone surgery and was resting, surrounded by family and friends. He had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience. \"It seems he survived by sheer willpower,\" said Akhilesh Shrestha, a doctor who treated Khanal, according to the Reuters news agency. Khanal's story of survival isn't the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake, which has killed more than 5,000 people. A 4-month-old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of Bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck, the newspaper Kathmandu Today reported. A Nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard, the newspaper said. The little boy, whose name is Sonit Awal, was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries, according to initial examinations. CNN hasn't independently confirmed Sonit's rescue, but the newspaper published photos showing the dust-caked infant being lifted by Nepali soldiers in the ruined structure. Tanka Maya Sitoula, a 40-year-old mother of four, was at home in Kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city, bringing the five-story building down around her ground-floor apartment. She endured 36 long hours trapped in a room before an Indian rescue team freed her. She escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula says she remained confident she would survive amid the rubble. \"I heard people making noise outside, so I thought I would be rescued,\" she said, as she and her family sheltered on the grounds of a nearby school. What did she do for 36 hours? \"I was just lying down,\" she said. \"There was no room to move here and there.\" Sitoula's husband, Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. It took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived, he said. And it took another 18 hours to free her. Jon Keisi was buried for more than 60 hours under the wreckage of a seven-story building in Kathmandu that came tumbling down around him during the quake. Rescue workers flown in from Turkey had to help carve a tunnel deep into the debris to reach him. Encased in an orange stretcher, he was lifted to safety Tuesday. But he cried out in pain after his rescuers set him down, shaking his head from side to side. One of the hard-hat-wearing search team members that crowded around him called for water. Keisi was injured and dehydrated, but the rescuers said they were confident he would survive. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph reported from Kathmandu, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

While the BBC claimed the plate, which read H982 FKL, was an 'unhappy coincidence', Maria Cristina Barrionuevo said they were deliberately 'provoking people' when they drove it through the country last year. In a report released earlier this week she slammed their actions as 'arrogant and disrespectful'. Scroll down for video A judge has ruled the controversial number plate that led to Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear colleagues being thrown out of Argentina was a deliberate reference to the 1982 Falklands War Clarkson and his colleagues fled the South American country last year when their convoy - which was led by a Porsche bearing the controversial number plate - came under attack. A village of Falklands War veterans targeted the team as they drove through Patagonia, with Clarkson claiming in one account that they stormed their hotel. They were accused of deliberately inciting conflict with the plate, an alleged reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Afterwards producers removed the plate and replaced it with another. Investigating whether this was illegal, Mrs Barrionuevo said: 'It should be understood that it is not up to me to investigate or evaluate the decision - arrogant and disrepectful to say the least - by the Top Gear production team to enter the country with one or more Malvinas-referenced number plates. 'Nor is it my job to gauge the reaction - anticipated - of citizens to such an offence. Clarkson (pictured this week) said an angry mob targeted the Top Gear team in their hotel. His producer, Andy Wilman (right), who announced his resignation on Wednesday, denied deliberately using the plate 'My responsibility is to analyse whether a crime has been committed under Argentinian law in relation to the removal from the Porsche of the original number plate H982 FKL and its replacement by another.' Concluding Top Gear chiefs had not acted in 'bad faith' in changing the plates and their hand was forced by 'massive government and popular pressure', she added: 'It led them to remove the original number plate and replace it with another which in principle wouldn't have negative connotations with the aim of ending the main focus of conflict and avoiding violent reactions by locals which indeed ended up taking place. 'The change was not done in a surreptitious way, but with the knowledge and approval of the presenters who participated in meetings with the programme producers.' Local prosecutors have already been informed of the decision and are understood to be preparing an appeal. Judges in the nearby city of Rio Grande - where Clarkson\u2019s Porsche is thought to be in storage - are now expected to be asked to order Clarkson and his pals to be called in for a court grilling by overturning Mrs Barrionuevo's decision. The group's convoy was attacked as they drove through Patagonia. They abandoned the cars in Argentina to flee the country Clarkson, 55, and co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May fled Argentina with a police escort after being told to leave the country as angry Falklands War veterans threatened to kill him. They cut short filming for a Christmas special and took flew to the capital Buenos Aires before returning to Britain. Nearly 30 other members of the film crew were stoned as they headed for Chile by road and had to abandon Clarkson\u2019s Porsche and the cars his co-hosts had driven on a 1,400-mike trip through southern Argentina. The number plate that sparked calls for a full criminal probe - HI VAE - was found on the battered Porsche which was attacked by a furious mob after it was left at the side of the road. A local councillor in Ushuaia later claimed the digits 269 on the number plate of the Ford Mustang Richard Hammond had driven were close to the 255 Britons killed during the war - and the numbers 646 on James May\u2019s Lotus could be taken as a reference to the 649 Argentinian casualties. The furore sparked a diplomatic incident with Argentina\u2019s ambassador Alicia Castro calling the H982 plate 'malicious mockery' of those who fought in the 1982 Falklands War. Andy Wilman, who this week announced he was resigning from the show, insisted it was 'completely untrue' the Clarkson car had been chosen for its number plate or that an alternative plate was substituted for the original one. Clarkson told the Argentinian ambassador she could 'go fooey' ahead of the screening of the Top Gear special last December. The presenters were filming a Christmas special in the South American country last year when the controversy erupted He is now rumoured to be working on a new car show format with Wilman which they are expected to take to a rival British TV channel, Netflix or Amazon. They were spotted in London on Thursday with Richard Hammond and James May, entering Clarkson\u2019s home before leaving together for a drink at a local pub. Hammond, 45, has joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear following Clarkson's sacking, insisting yesterday/on Friday he had no plan to 'quit my mates.' Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. The incident led to the BBC deciding not to renew Clarkson\u2019s contract after the current Top Gear series finishes. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would \u2018not be pursuing the matter any further.\u2019", "candidate_sentences": ["BBC claimed H982 FKL plate was an 'unhappy coincidence' Maria Cristina Barrionuevo said they were deliberately 'provoking people' Group's convoy was attacked as they drove through Patagonia last year.", "They were accused of deliberately inciting conflict with the plate.", "Afterwards producers removed the plate and replaced it with another."], "candidate_words": [["BBC", "claimed", "H982", "FKL", "plate", "was", "an", "'unhappy", "coincidence'", "Maria", "Cristina", "Barrionuevo", "said", "they", "were", "deliberately", "'provoking", "people'", "Group's", "convoy", "was", "attacked", "as", "they", "drove", "through", "Patagonia", "last", "year."], ["They", "were", "accused", "of", "deliberately", "inciting", "conflict", "with", "the", "plate."], ["Afterwards", "producers", "removed", "the", "plate", "and", "replaced", "it", "with", "another."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Bueno played for Derby on loan five years ago, but with just five goals in 29 games he looked anything like Champions League material. After returning to Valladolid he moved to Rayo Vallecano and at the club with one of the lowest budgets in Spanish football he has had the season of his life. Now Champions League quarter-finalists Porto, coached by Spaniard Julen Lopetegui, are ready to poach him.

He hit four in one game earlier this year against Levante and will be gunning for his old club on Wednesday night. Bueno came through at Real Madrid in the 2006-07 season when then manager Fabio Capello fast-tracked him from the C-team to train with David Beckham, Luis Figo and Raul. He eventually made his full debut in both La Liga and the Champions League two seasons later but like so many strikers from Real Madrid\u2019s youth system before him he was going to have to leave to really launch his career. Following in the footsteps of Alvaro Negredo and Roberto Soldado he left the club in 2009 signing for Valladolid from where he spent a season at Derby before ending up back in Spain.

{"id": "8610ead0a43054be202a1fc756620415a6d572fe", "article": "(CNN)Recently, a New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook. What exactly is \"service of process\"? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go \"off the grid\". Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is \"nail and mail\" service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of \"service\" is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, \"traditional\" doesn't necessarily mean \"good.\"  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be \"liked\" by all your gawking \"friends,\" we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we \"live\" in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email.", "candidate_sentences": ["A New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook.", "The ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person.", "In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons."], "candidate_words": [["A", "New", "York", "judge", "issued", "an", "opinion", "authorizing", "service", "of", "divorce", "papers", "on", "a", "husband", "completely", "via", "Facebook."], ["The", "ideal", "and", "fairest", "way", "to", "notify", "a", "person", "of", "a", "lawsuit", "is", "to", "have", "another", "human", "hand", "the", "papers", "to", "the", "defendant", "in", "person."], ["In-person", "service", "is", "not", "always", "possible,", "for", "obvious", "reasons."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

The state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a \u00a3446million loss for the first three months of the year. It comes after RBS was forced to put aside \u00a3856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided, including an extra \u00a3334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks. Down: RBS reposted a \u00a3446million loss in the first three months of the year In addition to fines in the US, the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the UK. RBS was also hit with a \u00a3453million restructuring charge, mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the US. The loss is a blow to taxpayers, who own 80 per cent of the bank, and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne, six days before the General Election. A return to profit for both RBS and state-backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008. Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector, but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the \u00a346billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis. Disgraced former RBS boss  Fred Goodwin (pictured) was among those courted by former prime minister Tony Blair. Mr Goodwin was knighted for \u2018services to banking\u2019 in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 Chief executive Ross McEwan said: \u2018This is going to be another tough year. There are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon. We look forward to the day we can focus entirely on the future rather than dealing with legacy issues.\u2019 The latest news wiped more than \u00a3700million off the value of RBS as shares fell more than 3 per cent to 338.5p.

Authorities said the Northern California boy fell asleep in the backseat of the car and was kidnapped when the vehicle was stolen An eight-year-old boy who took a snooze in the backseat of his family's car, apparently slept through his own kidnapping after the car was stolen from in front of his home. Brock Guzman was found safe and well about two miles away from his Northern Californian home in the abandoned car following a frantic search for him. Police said a hapless car thief likely stole the 2001 Toyota Corolla after the boy's father left it running and briefly unattended in front of his home. But the car thief clearly didn't notice the boy curled up on the backseat fast asleep as he sped away with the vehicle. The boy's father said he had placed Brock in the Corolla at around 4:45 a.m., and started the engine. He then went back into the house in Fairfield to get some belongings and his older son, who attends school 40 miles away in Napa. However, when the father went back outside, the car was gone and an unfamiliar bicycle lay nearby. In a blind panic, he hopped into another family vehicle and sped off in search of the Corolla. The boy's mother frantically called 911, and authorities issued an Amber Alert. Less than four hours later, a resident called police and said the car was parked in their neighborhood. When officers cautiously approached it at around 8:15 a.m., the suspect was gone and Brock was still asleep. He was not injured. Fairfield police Officer Kathryn McCormick said: 'We don't know for sure if he slept through the whole thing, but it looks that way. We hope that was the case.' Police do not have a description of the suspect and say it appears that the thief did not know the child was sleeping in the backseat. 'At this point, we are investigating this as a crime of opportunity,' McCormick said.

A dramatic interview with a famed spiritual leader -- and the tearful reaction by one of his former students. These are some of the best videos of the week: In the 1980s and '90s -- before he moved to Vegas and started keeping tigers as pets -- former heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson lived in a Southington, Ohio, mansion. The home featured an indoor swimming pool, a marble-and-gold Jacuzzi (with mirrored ceiling, naturally) and an entertainment room large enough for small concerts. Tyson sold the house in 1999; it's due to become, of all things, a church. The video can be seen at the top of this story. Not a fan of roller coasters? You may want to skip the next video -- but for the rest of us, the thrill of watching is the next best thing to being there. The Fury 325 can be found at Carowinds amusement part in Charlotte, North Carolina. Watch the video: In a CNN exclusive, Alisyn Camerota looked into allegations that Bikram yoga creator Bikram Choudhury sexually assaulted six former students. \"He's a person who's based a lot of truths on a lot of lies,\" said Sarah Baughn, who alleges that Choudhury sexually assaulted her.

In the pictures O\u2019Toole, the star of 1962 classic film Lawrence of Arabia, can be seen laughing and joking with fellow cast members despite suffering from a long-term illness that would eventually prove fatal.

He said: \u2018Peter was certainly not the type to let illness decide over his career, and despite his being poorly at the time of filming, he remained full-on 10 hours a day, showing great interest in the storylines, angles of shots and the lighting.\u2019 He added: \u2018Of course, the inevitable wind-ups surfaced whenever the devil inside him needed entertaining. Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria attempts to pay homage to Saint Katherine by portraying her as a real women who experiences fear and torment while remaining steadfast in her beliefs regarding the denouncement of Rome\u2019s enforced pagan worship upon the masses. Director Michael Redwood said Peter O\u2019Toole was certainly not the type to let illness interrupt his career Redwood said: \u2018My agenda was simple: painstaking research, to create an intelligent screenplay and to seek out Britain\u2019s best performers for their unrivalled ability to help portray the story of this religious icon. \u2018The dialogue demanded some of the world\u2019s most recognisable voices such as Peter O\u2019Toole and Edward Fox, who were an inspiration to work with. Katherine\u2019s voice had to be most haunting in its delivery.\u2019 The director also paid tribute to the late actor\u2019s sense of humour and noted that his onscreen chemistry was quickly established with Keniheart on account of the pair discovering that they had both had similar, difficult pasts. Michael Redwood stated that on screen chemistry was quickly established between Peter O'Toole and Nicole Keniheart Director Michael Redwood has a word with Peter O\u2019Toole on the set of\u00a0Fall of an Empire: The Story of Katherine of Alexandria Redwood said: \u2018Peter managed to politely subdue his mischievousness with Keniheart, but not for long, as she well found out when filming an intimate library scene together. \u2018I'd asked Peter to perhaps whisper something to make Ms Keniheart smile after about 30 seconds of a long tracking shot that contained no dialogue, and what he said did indeed make her burst into a grin, but, what he said could never be printed.\u2019 O\u2019Toole enjoyed a long and decorated career and was nominated for a total of eight Academy Awards, received an honorary Oscar, and won four Golden Globes.

Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line. 'I'm disappointed with the first half, I don't like when we start like that,' said Royals boss Steve Clarke. 'We didn't really recover from that, we just really coasted along, we didn't try to make anything happen. Second half at least we tried to make something happen.

But these giant arrows, which can measure up to 70ft in length, are actually a forgotten remnant of a bygone age. Dotted among scrubland, placed in seemingly random spots, these huge arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the US - forming the first land-based navigation system in the world. A huge concrete arrow is found in perfect condition in Bloomington,\u00a0Washington County, Utah The Bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith, who have travelled across the US to photograph the monuments The concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways, showing pilots the direction they needed to fly in to reach the next stop-off to deliver mail. Airmail in the US began as early as 1911, with the first official flight departing\u00a0Petaluma, California, and arriving in Santa Rosa, California. As the flights got longer, with more frequent stop-offs, so the beacons and arrows were placed to help pilots on their way. Following World War One, the US Postal Service began to use surplus war planes for mail delivery and many were flown by former army pilots. The arrows define a moment in history at the beginning of the 21st century when the US Postal service began delivering air mail Perfectly set against the snow-capped mountains of Nevada, this arrow was photographed in Golconda,\u00a0Humboldt County Captured near the tiny town of Medicine Bow in Wyoming, this beacon was on the famous New York to San Francisco route One of the most important flight routes and the first to be completed, stretched across the US from New York to San Francisco The giant arrows started to be placed across the country, sometimes at 10-mile intervals, from 1924. Painted bright yellow and placed alongside beacon with a gas light at the top, the idea was that the markers could be seen for a distance of up to 10 miles so pilots could find their way. In the summer of 1924, they stretched from Wyoming to Ohio and by the following year, the arrows had reached New York. By 1929, the arrows could direct flights all the way across the width of America. The main New York to San Francisco air route stretched from New York to San Francisco, following the yellow concrete trail. Medicine Bow\u00a0town in Carbon County has a population of just 284 and was originally established due to the construction of a transcontinental railroad Not all the arrows are in good condition, with each passing winter more cracks appear in the concrete, such as with this arrow in Mote, Nevada Pumpernickle n Nevada has its own concrete arrow too, which one again is overlooked by the state's beautiful mountains In the days before radio and satellite communications, the arrows were a way to ensure pilots could find their way, even in poor weather. While the arrows are now long-forgotten, with many lost forever, there are fans who, having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside, have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind. Retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith were sent an email which piqued their interest and have been hunting down the arrows ever since. The email playfully explained: 'Every so often, usually in the vast deserts of the American Southwest, a hiker or a backpacker will run across something puzzling: a large concrete arrow, as much as seventy feet in length, sitting in the middle of scrub-covered nowhere.' The couple say they have found 102 arrows so far and have set up their website Arrows Across America as part of their photography site dreamsmithphotos.com\u00a0so fellow fans can share their own pictures and help map where the remaining arrows are. The Smiths told MailOnline Travel: 'We have located 102 arrows or portions of arrows, some are badly deteriorated and not much is left. Arrowheads and ancient earth mounds have been discovered at Poverty Point, in Utah, but it also has a more recent concrete arrow A beacon has survived in good condition in New Mexico (left) and at Cottage Grove in Oregon (right) - many of these were lost as the metal was used in the war effort during the Second World War At Thayer Juntion, in Wyoming, there are boards that supply information about the arrows and their use to passers-by 'Our interest grew out of an email circulating in August 2013, we wanted to know where they were, and set out to find them. 'We have managed to take photos of approximately 40, and have a trip planned this fall to take more photos of some that we were unable to get to last spring.

McElroy, who teaches legal writing, got tripped up on the $12,500 level after flying through the first few questions, notes Philly.com. Wishes she was a millionaire: Drexel law profesor professor Lisa McElroy allegedly sent a link to a pornographic website to her students. In 2010, she appeared on the TV game show Who Wants to Be a Milionaire Mother of two: The mother of two shared an anecdote with then-host Meredith Vieira about having to scramble to find a babysitter for her kids and someone to teach her class after learning she was to appear on the show just two days before taping Lost it: McElroy was tripped up on the $12,500 question. Despite having used two lifelines, she answered wrong and walked away with around $5,000 The questions read: 'As a result of General Motor\u2019s bankruptcy declaration in 2009, what foreign government became one of its largest shareholders?' Even after using two of her lifelines to narrow down the answer, McElroy answered China, which was incorrect. The correct answer was Canada. She walked away with around $5,000.

She opened the appearance by sharing an anecdote with Vieira about having to scramble to find a babysitter after being informed she was chosen to be on Millionaire jsut two days prior to taping.

The message read: 'As you may be aware, some students erroneously received an email this morning directing them to a... post that included some inappropriate material. 'We take this matter seriously and apologize for any upset it may have caused.' The university says federal law requires it investigate all reports of inappropriate behaviors of a sexual nature.

James Creag, 11, is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside. He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, whose victims are nicknamed 'real-life vampires' because their skin cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. James Creag must use the special brown suncream (pictured) as he suffers from a rare sunlight allergy He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, which means he suffers from terrible sunburn (pictured) when exposed to sunlight James, from Salford in Greater Manchester, was given Dundee Reflective Sunscreen, a thick brown paste which blocks out the light. But when strangers shouted out abuse such as 'chocolate face' and 'you're coloured' because of his unusual appearance, he refused to wear it any more. His mother Claire, 34, said: 'When he had the cream on he was called names - the kind of names a racist would say. I don't know why. 'It was either ignorance or evilness. People think he's different so they taunted him. It's so cruel. I hate that people take the mickey out of him. 'The cream was meant to protect him but he's stopped wearing it now.' The unfortunate schoolboy has to wear a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, and gloves in all weather so he is not harmed by the sun, which would be like having 'boiling water poured on him'. However, his condition can also can flare up when he is inside, so his parents have installed specially dimmed windows to block out the sun's rays. 'His school got new lightbulbs in October,' Mrs Creag said. 'Immediately he started getting pins and needles and his body swelled up. He was in agony, I was so worried. 'It turned out he was suffering a reaction to the new daylight bulb lights. The school put a special coating over them and now he is lots better. Family: James with his mother Claire and younger sister Grace, who does not have the condition EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation She added: 'He was first diagnosed when he was two. He was playing football in the garden with my husband, Daniel. 'But after half an hour outside, they came running towards me, James screaming. He said his hands hurt. They had swollen up so much they looked like boxing gloves. 'I put them under the cold tap and looked at him. His skin was red hot and burning. It was far worse than sunburn - his hands were three times the size.' The family visited their GP, who suggested that James might be allergic to grass. 'He was given steroid tablets to help with the swelling and we were sent away,' his mother said. 'But it kept happening and I took James to the doctors three times that week. 'Painkillers and allergy tablets didn't help. Every time he was outside, any exposed skin became red raw, his face and hands would swell up. He would scream in pain and no sun cream made any difference.' Eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition. 'We were told to wrap him up and use the special cream,' Mrs Creag added. 'So, even if it's overcast, James still wears a hat, scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin. The Dundee cream is so important.' She spoke of her joy at discovering that her daughter Grace had not inherited the illness despite the genetic risks - and paid tribute to James for his bravery. 'Even after all he's been through James is brilliant,' Mrs Creag said. 'He is your typical 11-year-old lad. Even when he is flaring up, he just shrugs his shoulders. I admire him. 'He always wears a hat too He just puts up with it though. He\u2019s so brave and doesn\u2019t let it get him down. Even though other kids can play football in the sunshine.' Mrs Creag continued: 'Doctors said his EPP was an inherited condition. Daniel had a variant gene, I had a mutant gene. So when I fell pregnant with Grace I was terrified she\u2019d be born with EPP too.

And that\u2019s what today is all about.\u2019 He will add that it is \u2018wrong \u2013 frankly immoral \u2013 for Government to spend money like it grows on trees\u2019. Among the raft of changes coming into effect today, on what Mr Cameron will dub \u2018money back Monday\u2019, are: Other measures to encourage saving will also begin, with the Isa limit increasing to \u00a315,240 and the 10p savings tax band abolished. Treasury analysis shows the changes will benefit 14million working households to the tune of \u00a317 a month. And nearly million pensioner households \u2013 more than nine in ten \u2013 will benefit by \u00a315 a month. Middle income households earning around \u00a323,000 a year will benefit the most, and the top ten per cent of earners the least. Today will also see the abolition of the old pensions annuities, allowing retirement money to be accessed like a current account. Mr Cameron will say the changes make Britain a \u2018better and fairer place to live\u2019, adding that low taxes \u2018go to the heart of what I believe as a Conservative. \u2018For me, there\u2019s the economic case: That, in a competitive world, we need to incentivise work by making it pay. \u2018There\u2019s the progressive case: That the best way to help with living standards is to let people keep more of the money they earn. \u2018But above all, there is the moral case: That it is wrong \u2013 frankly immoral \u2013 for Government to spend money like it grows on trees.\u2019 He will also pledge to eliminate the deficit \u2018without reaching into working people\u2019s pockets like Labour would\u2019. However, in a speech in Yorkshire, Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are \u00a31,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes. And he will warn that the Conservatives will raise VAT. Mr Balls will say: \u2018David Cameron and George Osborne are going round the country telling people they\u2019ve never had it so good. How out of touch can they get? \u2018The truth is millions are worse off because of this government\u2019s choices. \u2018And while millions are paying more, millionaires are paying less. Two years ago today they gave the top one per cent of earners in our country a \u00a33billion a year tax cut.\u2019 Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will point to figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing families are \u00a31,100 a year worse off over the past five years as a result of government tax and spending changes The Lib Dems said that the changes to income tax had been part of their manifesto and said Labour would cost 24million taxpayers \u00a3340 a year. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will say today: \u2018In government, we secured a tax cut totalling \u00a3825 every year for millions of ordinary working people. We now plan to take this further, raising the [tax-free personal allowance] threshold to \u00a312,500 and giving millions of people a further tax cut worth nearly \u00a3400.\u2019", "candidate_sentences": ["Prime Minister will set out the Conservative case for people keeping more of their own money.", "He will make a bold argument for continued lower taxes, with less spent on \u2018bureaucracy\u2019 and \u2018crackpot Government schemes\u2019 \u2018There is no such thing as public money, there is only taxpayers\u2019 money,\u2019 he will say."], "candidate_words": [["Prime", "Minister", "will", "set", "out", "the", "Conservative", "case", "for", "people", "keeping", "more", "of", "their", "own", "money."], ["He", "will", "make", "a", "bold", "argument", "for", "continued", "lower", "taxes,", "with", "less", "spent", "on", "\u2018bureaucracy\u2019", "and", "\u2018crackpot", "Government", "schemes\u2019", "\u2018There", "is", "no", "such", "thing", "as", "public", "money,", "there", "is", "only", "taxpayers\u2019", "money,\u2019", "he", "will", "say."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Boffins are currently working towards digitally recreating the cognitive abilities of the Apis Mellifera or European Honeybee. Their final aim is to build a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like the tiny insects. Scientists are working towards building a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like a honeybee Professor James Marshall said if they were able to recreate a fraction of the honeybees ability they would have made 'tremendous advances' The artificial brain is being created by the Green Brain Project, which is a collaboration between researchers from the Universities of Sheffield and Sussex. One day it is hoped the remote controlled machines could be used to pollinate crops or even assist on search and rescue missions. 'Bees and all other insects are miracles of engineering which we are nowhere near equalling,' Professor James Marshall reportedly told the BBC. 'If we could even recreate a fraction of their abilities in a robot system then we would have made a tremendous advance.' Building an artificial brain is a complex process and so far, scientist have only managed to clone the part of the bee's brain which allows it to see. To do this they mapped out the  brain of the honeybee and recreated it with circuits that fire on and off in an organic brain, Discovery Magazine reported. The software is then uploaded into the drone's circuitry which enables it to  fly around in a similar fashion to the bee. The projects team now has three quadcopters and one ground robot, each with unique abilities and configurations. Tests are being carried out in a dedicated flying room based at the University of Sheffield. In a video footage showing initial tests the drone, powered by the artificial bee brain, can be seen flying down a corridor. On the Green Brain website it states: 'Since the start of the project, the GB team has setup the lab, built and tested our robots, and begun to demonstrate some sophisticated visual-based navigation and cognitive functions through embodiment. 'Current projects include navigation using the GB models, flight tests of our models with the BeeBot quadcopter, developing a Ground Control Station, initial testing with the chemosensors and more.'

The Montgomery County Police Department said Friday that Alexander Soumbadze faces eight possession of child pornography counts. Soumbadze has recently admitted to trading and receiving child pornography, after which police say the Georgian national fled the country. An investigation also uncovered videos of the martial arts expert inappropriately touching and engaging in sexual acts with adolescent males at a Maryland karate studio where he was co-owner and instructor. Officials say the videos were taken before October 2011 and that they are attempting to locate victims to determine possible additional charges. According to Montgomery County police, the 26-year-old, a native of Tbilisi, Georgia, fled the US after confessing to the crimes. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of the Bethesda resident. According to a press release put out by the Montgomery County police Friday, in December 2014, the agency was tipped off by colleagues in South Dakota that a Maryland resident was uploading child pornography. Vile acts: Police have recovered videos showing the martial arts teacher (far right) molesting boys at the On The Mat Sports International in Chevy Chase, formerly known as DC Martial Arts Fugitive: The Tbilisi, Georgia, native admitted to trading child pornography videos earlier this month. Two days after his interview with police, he fled, possibly returning to his native country Armed with court orders, detectives in Maryland were able to obtain subscription information corresponding to the suspect, which led them to Soumbadze. On April 1, 2015, police executed a search warrant at Soumbadze\u2019s home in Bethesda, seizing several electronic devices that yielded eight pornographic videos featuring children. Other recordings recovered by police allegedly showed the suspect molesting boys at his karate studio on Wisconsin Avenue in Chevy Chase. Soumbadze has been affiliated with the On The Mat Sports International karate studio, formerly known as DC Martial Arts, since he was a young child and took classes there as a martial arts student.

People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce. It means an extra \u00a32,100 a year \u2013 \u00a317,800 rather than \u00a315,700 \u2013 to anyone who has kept their marriage intact, or who has never married, according to the survey for the Prudential. It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles. The debt of a divorced retiree averages \u00a322,100, Prudential\u2019s report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers. Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that \u00a39,500 \u2013 the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday\u2019s report said. The impact of divorce on a former spouse\u2019s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working. The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up. Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health. The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult, studies suggests The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands, wives and children suffer during a divorce \u2013 usually including loss of income, the price of running two homes instead of one, legal costs, and the long-term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse \u2013 does not fade away even as old age approaches. Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children, a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through \u2018pension-splitting\u2019 arrangements. One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles, according to research Prudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat said: \u2018Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement. \u2018A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple will have to split in the event of a divorce. Professional advice is particularly important in the face of the recent changes to pensions legislation and divorced retirees acting on advice received under the previous rules may want to consider seeking updated advice on any post-retirement plans they have made. \u2018During a divorce the costs can quickly mount up, with legal fees, the cost of setting up a new home and the effect of splitting any existing retirement savings all potentially impacting the ability of those involved to continue saving into a pension. Unfortunately divorce is most likely among those aged 40 to 44, the period in many people\u2019s lives when earning potential peaks and the most valuable pension contributions can be made.\u2019 The findings were based on a survey carried out by Research Pluse among 7,687 people aged over 45, who included 1,012 people intending to retire this year.", "candidate_sentences": ["People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13% higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce.", "Means an extra \u00a32,100 a year \u2013 \u00a317,800 rather than \u00a315,700 \u2013 to anyone who has kept their marriage intact.", "One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles."], "candidate_words": [["People", "who", "have", "never", "been", "divorced", "can", "expect", "a", "retirement", "income", "13%", "higher", "than", "a", "colleague", "who", "has", "been", "through", "a", "divorce."], ["Means", "an", "extra", "\u00a32,100", "a", "year", "\u2013", "\u00a317,800", "rather", "than", "\u00a315,700", "\u2013", "to", "anyone", "who", "has", "kept", "their", "marriage", "intact."], ["One", "in", "five", "divorcees", "who", "stop", "work", "this", "year", "will", "retire", "with", "debts", "to", "drag", "down", "their", "disposable", "income", "and", "their", "lifestyles."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Now Riddick Bowe, of Maryland, has found himself tweeting happy birthday messages and adverts for insurance firms for anyone who pays him $20. The 46-year-old recently offered to 'tweet anything' for people who credit him through PayPal, sharing the messages with his 450,000 followers. His offer seems a far cry from the fame he enjoyed in the 1990s as the only man who could beat Evander Holyfield. Bowe explained his plan to this thousands of followers in a post. He said: 'I will tweet anything to anyone just paypal me $20 bowe@riddickbowe.com. Thats whats up. Bowe And as apparent proof of his pledge a number of bizarre messages have since appeared on the former boxing champion's Twitter account. One post read: 'I tell you all now @JakeLeeYes is twice the fighter I ever was. Thats whats up. Bowe' And in others he posted messages from people asking for dates and venting their frustrations at taxi drivers, as well as promoting websites, small businesses and hotels. He wrote: 'Im now in the business of endorsing yo companies helping those small business get off them ground Im try help the little guy thats what i do.' His actions seem a fall from his hey day in the 1990s when Bowe was widely regarded as the best heavyweight fighter in the world. He motched up victories over former champion Evander Holyfield in 1992 at Caesars Palace and Andrew Golota, who was disqualified for low blows. He retired in 1997 and went on to join the Marine Corps Reserves, but dropped out while he was training. Next the boxer's fortunes were to take an even more disastrous turn after he was imprisoned for 18 months for domestic violence after he held his now ex-wife and children against their will. In 2004\u00a0he returned to the ring and won three bouts in unconvincing fashion. Bowe posted a message to his 451,000 followers offering to post any messages they wanted, and his tweets since then - from asking for dates to promoting companies - has proved that he means his offer By 2005 Bowe had filed for bankruptcy - a stark contrast to the days when he was rumoured to have $15million career earnings. His last fight was a win over Gene Pukall in Germany in 2008. By 2009 he was at a New Jersey flea market, according to the New York Times, selling his wares and speaking of his aim to return to the ring. In 2013 Bowe made a comeback as a Muay Thai fighter, but was spectacularly beaten in the second round. At the time he said he had tried the sport because he was bored of retirement and needed the cash. Bowe (right) faced Evander Holyfield (left) in 1992 and became the first person to beat the undefeated boxer Bowe (left) is pictured in 2004, having beaten his opponent Marcus Rhode at Fire Lake Casino Oklahoma The boxing champion has a chequered history with Twitter - being forced to apologise last year after he posted a message saying he wanted all Liverpool fans to die. He later said his message was a joke, as a dedicated Everton fan. In the 1990s Bowe became renowned for his victory over Holyfield, who has suffered a similar loss of his fortune. Holyfield beat Bowe the following year in a rematch and also scored several victories over Mike Tyson.

An announcement will be made by the Rugby Park club on Friday morning, with the former Hearts boss being given a three-year deal. And on Thursday the 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since he replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February. Kilmarnock will confirm Gary Locke as the club's new permanent manager on Friday \u2018I\u2019d be over the moon to get it as it\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked hard towards,\u2019 said Locke while negotiations were being finalised at the Ayrshire club. \u2018I had a taste of it (management) at Hearts and really enjoyed it. I\u2019m fortunate I was put into this position at a great club. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity. \u2018But I\u2019ve said all along, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about players. If they perform, you get a better reputation as a manager and that has been the case here with a great response from them. \u2018That\u2019s how football works. If they play well, your stock rises. Equally, if they don\u2019t play well, it\u2019s the manager who gets the stick. \u2018I\u2019ve got broad shoulders and I know what to expect but I can\u2019t praise the players highly enough. They have worked so hard and they have taken on board everything I have tried to tell them.\u2019 Ex-Killie and Hearts player Locke, who was crestfallen not to be retained by the Tynecastle club as head coach after they were relegated last season, added: \u2018(Coaches) Alan Robertson and Billy Thomson have done a fantastic job in helping me, too. \u2018You can\u2019t do all of these things by yourself and backroom staff can be as important as the players. I can\u2019t thank all of these people enough.\u2019 Locke, who returned to Rugby Park last summer, had been working as No 2 under Johnston when the manager announced in February that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season, indicating that the \u00a3150,000 sale of teenage forward Robbie Muirhead to Dundee United had been a factor in his decision. After Johnston was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy, assistant Locke was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop-gap appointment. But he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship. They only suffered their first reverse under Locke when Ross County beat them 2-1 in Dingwall two weeks ago. Kilmarnock went unbeaten during Locke's first six games in charge of the club He has impressed Mann not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm. Kilmarnock are currently eighth in the Premiership and still remain in the hunt for a top-six place. It was expected that Locke would have been appointed permanently before now, but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top-six finish this season. \u2018When you are dealing with contracts, they take a bit of time and I certainly don\u2019t foresee any problems,\u2019 he said. \u2018There hasn\u2019t really been a hold-up. As any player or manager will tell you, when it comes to the terms of a contract, it doesn\u2019t just happen overnight. There are a lot of things to discuss and I have done that. \u2018I will keep all that private because that is the way it should be and the club have dealt with it brilliantly. \u2018I\u2019ve no complaints there, so I hope it will be sorted before Saturday and I can concentrate on our home game against Motherwell. \u2018Our new board of directors have been fantastic. I\u2019ve been really impressed with the way that they have handled everything. The club itself is trying to be as positive as possible. \u2018There are a lot of plans in place to make the club even better than it is right now, so there are loads of positives and I would like to be part of that.\u2019 Having resolved his own situation, Locke will next week turn his attention to the futures of nine first-team players at Kilmarnock \u2014 Manuel Pascali, Alexei Eremenko, Craig Slater, Craig Samson, Sammy Clingan, Greg Kiltie, Conor Brennan, Chris Chantler and Mark O\u2019Hara \u2014 who will become free agents this summer. \u2018I\u2019ve said for a number of weeks now that once my own position was sorted out, there are a few players out of contract and they will want to know what their futures are,\u2019 he said. \u2018So it will be great to get moving on all of that and prepare for next season. \u2018You can\u2019t do that until you are the main man.\u2019", "candidate_sentences": ["Gary Locke will be confirmed as Kilmarnock's permanent manager on Friday.", "Locke replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February.", "The 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since taking charge at Rugby Park.", "Locke has been given a three-year deal."], "candidate_words": [["Gary", "Locke", "will", "be", "confirmed", "as", "Kilmarnock's", "permanent", "manager", "on", "Friday."], ["Locke", "replaced", "Allan", "Johnston", "on", "a", "caretaker", "basis", "in", "February."], ["The", "39-year-old", "paid", "tribute", "to", "the", "players", "whose", "efforts", "have", "helped", "him", "win", "favour", "with", "new", "chairman", "Jim", "Mann", "since", "taking", "charge", "at", "Rugby", "Park."], ["Locke", "has", "been", "given", "a", "three-year", "deal."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Scroll down for video The white-cheeked macaque, from Tibet, China, has a distinctive rounded penis compared to other macaques Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in Tibet. Human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis, but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom. An evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species. He concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners, or even as a way of cooling the body down. The relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe in his latest 'How Did We Get Here?' video series for the University of New South Wales, Australia. Gorillas have small penises and small testicles, while chimps have medium-sized penises and large testicles. By comparison, human males have the longest penis and medium-sized testicles. 'Amazingly the size of the reproductive organs, especially the testicles, are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially,' explained Professor Curnoe. 'Why the difference? Well for the testicles it's pretty straight forward. 'It all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps, and their sperm, have when they mate with females.' But he said there wasn't a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. He said: 'Medog County is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science. 'Furthermore, it locates in southeastern Tibet and close to McMahon line which is a political sensitive area. Very few have people studied primates there. 'This species has long been identified as Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) because no clear photos or good specimens are available.' In an attempt to better study the animals living in the region, Cheng Li, a photographer with the Imaging Biodiversity Expedition in Beijing, set up camera traps in the area's remote tropical and evergreen mountain forests. They captured 685 photos of macaques and Mr Li was also able to follow a group of macaques allowing him to obtain close up images. When the researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, examined the images they started to notice some monkeys that had different features. They the animals hd relatively short hairless tails and almost white hairs around their face. They also had long thick hairs on their neck. But the most distinctive feature was the creatures genitalia. Most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises. However, Macaca leucogenys had far more rounded penis and a dark hairy scrotum. Scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails (like those above) and light coloured markings around their face, leading them to identify a new species of primate The images above show the more usual 'arrow-shaped' genitalia that macaques in the area have Videos also revealed that Macaca leucogenys produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by Macaca assamensis as an alarm call. Dr Fan said the species seemed to inhabit a diverse range of habitats and was found living in tropical forests at 1,395 metres, evergreen broad-leaved forests at 2,400 metres and a mixed broad leaf and conifer forest at 2,700 metres. However, the researchers, who also included Choa Zhao from the Southwest Forestry University in Kunming, China, warned that the new species may be under threat. They said: 'The white-cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations. The white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of Medog in south east Tibet, China The researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of Macaca leucogenys become paler and more prominent with age. Infants can be seen in the images A and B while a juvenile is labelled C. Adult females are in the image D and adult males are seen on the far right of image E. Adults have few dark hairs on their faces 'Discovery of this new primate species further highlights the high value for biodiversity conservation of southeastern Tibet and calls for more intensive surveys, studies, and environmental protection in this area.' Dr Fan added that it was possible there could be other species of primate still to be discovered in the area. He said: 'This area has been little studied. 'Although primates have been intensively studied for decades, two new macaque species (Macaca munzala and M. leucogenys) were discovered and described in this area in the past 10 years. 'As for other species groups that received less attention, We believe there are still some species remain undiscovered. 'It is highly possible that some primate species still remain undiscovered.'

Iraqi officials said Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri had died in fighting with government troops in Salahuddin province, north of Baghdad. Al-Douri, 72, headed the Naqshbandi Order insurgent group, an important faction behind the recent rise of ISIS. Scroll down for video Al-Douri was an Iraqi military commander and was Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council, until the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the famous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse He was one of Saddam's most trusted henchmen, helping to lead his 1968 bloodless coup.\u00a0Both Al-Douri and Saddam came from the same Tikriti tribal background. He was then deputy to Saddam when he was deposed following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December, 2006, Al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Ba'ath Party. Al-Douri was deemed the most high-profile official of Saddam's Ba'ath Party to evade capture after the invasion. He was ranked sixth on the US military's list of the 55 most-wanted Iraqis after offensive to overthrow Saddam and had a $10m bounty on his head. He was the King of Clubs in the infamous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse. His dead body was pictured on social media today with his teeth missing, an unkempt orange beard and a bloody head wound. Salahuddin governor Raed al-Jabouri said soldiers and allied Shia militiamen killed him in an operation east of Tikrit - a city that was recaptured by the government two weeks ago. He said: 'This is a major victory for those involved in the operation. He is considered a mastermind for this terrorist group. 'For sure this will have an impact on them...there will be a break among them.' ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. However, in recent months Iraqi forces, supported by US-led air strikes, have captured large areas from the terrorist group. But today, a car bomb killed three people outside the U.S. consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region that is allied with Washington in a war against Islamic State, which claimed the attack. No U.S. personnel were hurt in the blast, according to the State Department which said a 'vehicle-borne improvised explosive device' exploded right outside the entrance to the heavily fortified compound. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for two car bombings in Baghdad that killed at least 27 people on Friday. 'The fighters of the Islamic State detonated two car bombs in the heart of the Iraqi capital this evening and a third in Erbil,' the group said via its news agency.

Arriving for sentencing at Manchester Magistrates Court yesterday dressed in a black blazer and jeans, Giggs, of Salford said the offence on October 14 last year 'wasn't intentional'. But Eddie Coyle, prosecuting, said: 'On October 14 last year at around 9.30pm, he was driving a Mercedes along Hyde Road in Ardwick when he was brought to a stop by officers who performed checks and confirmed no insurance was in force.' After accepting his wrongdoing, Giggs was asked whether he would like to pursue an 'exceptional hardship' application in an attempt to retain his licence. He declined but added that he would permanently lose his job as an HGV driver with an agency and hadn't worked since December as he was waiting for the decision of the courts. Speaking for himself with no legal representation, he said: 'I work for an agency. If I lost my job I could get something else. 'I want to get this sorted today. I haven't worked since December and have no income or benefits.' Giggs was then banned from driving for six months, fined \u00a3110 and ordered to pay a \u00a320 victim surcharge and \u00a385 costs.

The drug\u2019s use was accelerated by the US Food and Drug Administration which approved Avastin plus chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer in August 2014. Nearly 3,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the UK each year, and it kills around 1,000 women. Cervical cancer, which is cancer of the neck of the womb, is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under. It is treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and if diagnosed and treated early the outlook is good. However, for patients who are diagnosed when their cancer is at a more advanced stage it becomes more difficult to treat and a cure is unlikely.

The time between her diagnosis and death was just months, suggesting her cancer was already at an advanced stage on diagnosis and within five months it had spread. Cervical cancer:\u00a0Reality TV star Jade Goody died in 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease Avastin, which is also known as bevacizumab and widely used in patients with bowel cancer, is the first new treatment since the chemotherapy drug topotecan was approved in 2006. Dr Mary McCormack, Consultant Clinical Oncologist at University College Hospital, said \u2018Cervical cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in younger women. \u2018For those women with metastatic disease (that has spread) or whose cancer recurs after surgery/chemoradiation there are very few treatment options. It is very welcome indeed that when Avastin is added to chemotherapy it prolongs survival by approximately four months. \u2018For a young mother sitting in front of you with small children, or indeed any patient with cancer, that length of time can be extremely important.\u2019 Robert Music, chief executive of Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust, said \u2018This regulatory decision for Avastin is positive news. To date, prognosis for women who receive a late-stage diagnosis of cervical cancer has often been poor. \u2018Any additional time that can be provided through new drugs with limited impact on quality of life is extremely valuable to patients and their families.\u2019 Trial findings show Avastin combined with chemotherapy can extend the lives of women with advanced cervical cancer by 26 per cent compared with chemotherapy alone. The drug, made by Switzerland-based drug makers Roche, led to overall survival of 17 months compared to 13 months. Avastin works by blocking the blood supply to the tumour, starving it of oxygen and nutrients. An independent blood supply is critical for a tumour to grow beyond 2mm and spread to other parts of the body.11 Tumours develop their own blood supply in a process called angiogenesis by releasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) \u2013 a key driver for tumour growth.

One of the men 38-year-old Lianna Barrientos wed was deported back to Pakistan for making threatening statements against the United States in 2006 after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, it has been revealed. Barrientos, originally from the Dominican Republican, lived with her partner and two children in the Bronx until her arrest in February, however was legally married to at least four people at the time. In court today, prosecutors said Barrientos married men from\u00a0Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, Mali and Georgia - countries that were 'red flags' for immigration, according to\u00a0The New York Daily News. At one time she was married to eight men simultaneously. Always the bride:\u00a0Liana Barrientos, 39, of the Bronx, pleaded not guilty on Friday to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences Sullen: Barrientos, seen here in Bronx Supreme Court on Friday, is accused of marrying 10 men over the course of 11 years in an apparent immigrant scam Charged: The Bronx district attorney's office says she faces two counts of felony fraud charges Swindle: Barrientos is accused of accepting money in at least one of the marriages, prosecutors say All of her marriages took place in New York state, allegedly starting in 1999. Authorities only cottoned on after she said her 2010 marriage to Salle Keita, of Mali,\u00a0- \u00a0the tenth time she tied the knot - was actually her first, the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0reported. This launched an investigation that unraveled a totaly of ten times Barrientos has allegedly walked down the aisle. Barrientos would spell her name differently on some marriage licenses and would file all over the state, in places including Westchester County, Mamaroneck, White Plains, Ramapo and Long Island, investigators said. Six of the sham marriages occurred in one year, authorities allege. The Daily News reported that it was her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, that was deported to his home country of Pakistan following an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. She has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences. 'This is a huge breach in security,' national security expert Manny Gomez told WABC. 'If someone could remarry 10 times without bringing it to the attention of the authorities, potentially an al-Qaeda plant could come in, marry this woman and be in this country illegally, plotting, recruiting, perhaps even executing a terrorist attack.' Bride: Liana Barrientos, pictured, has been married ten times. Her first marriage took place in 1999, with most recent being in 2010 Barrientos' marriage took place in 1999 to Mohamed Gerbril The bride and her grooms: This map shows Barrientos' marriages from 1999 to 2010 Barrientos' first marriage took place in 1999 to Mohamed Gerbril, followed by a 2001 marriage to Ahmed Allam, then a second 2001 marriage to Habibur Rahman, the Post reported. According to the newspaper, Barrientos married six men in 2002 - namely Davit Koridze, Duran Goktepe, Aliaksandr Paharelau, Vakhtang Dzneladze, Rashid Rajput, and Kakhaber Khorbaladze - and her last marriage was in 2010 to Salle Keita. Authorities reportedly slapped her with offering a false instrument for filing felony charges in November 2014. Quoting court documents,\u00a0The New York Daily News\u00a0said '[Barrientos] ... stated in sum and substance that she did marry Mr. Keita and that was her first and only marriage.' The newspaper reported that Barrientos could be sentenced to a total of eight years stemming from her two charges. Barrientos has been arrested multiple times, including for loitering, drug possession, and jumping a turnstile and trespassing, according to the Daily News. Mystery: The Department of Homeland Security was 'involved' in Barrientos' case, the Bronx district attorney's office told the New York Times According to the New York Times, '[Barrientos] has divorced at least four times, from husbands Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 7, but long after marrying husbands 3 through 9.' The Times reported that for her first three 2002 marriages, Barrientos wed Koridze on Valentine's Day, before she went on to marry Goktepe approximately two weeks later, then soon tied the knot with Paharelau. The Department of Homeland Security was 'involved' in Barrientos' case, the Bronx district attorney's office revealed to the Times. Barrientos' Facebook profile says she hails from the Dominican Republic and lives in Manhattan. It also says she became engaged in July 2013. Wedding bells? Barrientos' Facebook says she became engaged in July 2013 A Bronx building superintendent, Ruben George, told the New York Post 'She was arrested... and [her baby daddy Carlos Garcia] doesn't want her back.

Fighters from 100 nations \u2013 more than half the countries in the world \u2013 have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to research by the United Nations. Worryingly, the report warned if IS was defeated in the war-torn region then the barbarous foreign fighters could be scattered across the world. Scroll down for video More than 20,000 foreign fighters from more than half the countries in the world have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to a report by the United Nations The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with over 20,000 foreign fighters travelling to the region to fight for mainly IS but also the Al-Nusra Front. The panel said the thousands of foreign fighters who travelled to both countries are living and working in \u2018a veritable \u201cinternational finishing school\u201d for extremists\u2019 as was the case in Afghanistan in the 1990s. Afghan security forces estimated in March \u2013 three months after British troops withdrew - that about 6,500 foreign fighters were active in the country. And it said hundreds of foreigners are fighting in Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, around 100 in Somalia, and others in the Sahel countries in northern Africa, and in the Philippines. The panel of experts monitoring UN sanctions against Al-Qaeda said in the report that the scale of the problem has increased over the past three years and the flow of foreign fighters \u2018is higher than it has ever been historically\u2019. The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory The overall number of foreign terrorist fighters has \u2018risen sharply from a few thousand ... a decade ago to more than 25,000 today,\u2019 the panel said in the report to the UN Security Council. A military defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could have the unintended consequence of scattering foreign terrorist fighters across the world, the panel said. It noted that the \u2018watch list\u2019 in Turkey - a key crossing point to Syria and Iraq - now includes 12,500 individuals. And while governments are focusing on countering the threat from fighters returning home, the panel said it\u2019s possible that some may be traumatised by what they saw and need psychological help. Others may be recruited by criminal networks. The number of countries the fighters come from has also risen dramatically from a small group in the 1990s to over 100 today, including some that have never had previous links with Al-Qaeda associated groups, the panel said. It cited the \u2018high number\u2019of foreign fighters from Tunisia, Morocco, France and Russia, the increase in fighters from the Maldives, Finland and Trinidad and Tobago, and the first fighters from some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with fighters mainly travelling to the region to fight for  IS but also the Al-Nusra Front (pictured, a fighter from the Al-Qaeda linked militant group) The panel said the fighters and their networks \u2018pose an immediate and long-term threat\u2019 and \u2018an urgent global security problem\u2019 that needs to be tackled on many fronts and has no easy solution.

Preparing for their weekend clash at home to West Ham United, Manuel Pellegrini's  stars were all in action at their Etihad Campus base. Fresh from scoring Premier League goals 99 and 100 in his City career,  striker Sergio Aguero was back to his menacing best as he took part in shooting practice against goalkeeper Joe Hart. Manchester City players were  trained on Wednesday ahead of their match on Sunday at home to West Ham City striker Sergio Aguero fine-tuned his finishing skills with some shooting practice at their Etihad Campus Yaya Toure (left) and Samir Nasri are reportedly two players who could leave the club in the summer Aguero, who signed a new five-year contract with the club in August, will certainly be one player who will remain at the Etihad next season. The same cannot necessarily be said for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri - who are reportedly two players  City are willing to listen to offers for in the summer. And the midfield duo looked out in the cold at one point during Wednesday's session as they appeared  as Nasri underwent some stretching exercises. In the aftermath of Sunday's defeat to United at Old Trafford, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Graeme Souness were highly critical of Toure. Of the 31-year-old, the latter said that he had become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Toure was criticised by Sky Sports' Gary Neville and Graeme Souness after City's loss at Manchester United 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why Both the Ivory Coast international and Nasri have come under criticism for recent displays on the pitch, but Pellegrini will still be calling on their services as they look to cement a top four finish this season. The 61-year-old's side currently sit fourth in the Premier League with seven games remaining - four points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool and with a far greater goal difference too.

But amateur footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch, where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff who were believed to have stopped his friends from walking between the stadium's West and East stands. Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after appearing to fight with stewards After initially being restrained (first photo), Spahic became involved in a clash with staff after the game Spahic later seemed to aim a headbutt at a member of stadium staff, even after the angry clash had died down Spahic is pictured taking on Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm for the ball during the DFB-Pokal quarter-final The incident has been referred to the public prosecutor in Cologne and could now be investigated by police.  Spahic will issue an apology for his behaviour. A Bayer spokesman said: 'It is clear that there has been a physical dispute after the final whistle. We will review the incident and try to clarify now who was there and why they were there.' In the video Spahic, wearing a red club top, is at first restrained by two stewards as members of his group clash with the stadium staff.

Stancil is accused of killing an employee Monday at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina. Relatives have said victim Ron Lane was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported, and investigators are looking into whether the shooting was a hate crime. Authorities arrested Stancil after he was found sleeping on a Florida beach on Tuesday. Just a few minutes into Thursday's hearing on the first-degree murder charge he faces, Stancil snapped back at the judge after he was offered a court-appointed lawyer. \"No, I don't need one,\" said Stancil, who stood before the judge with his legs shackled and his arms handcuffed in front of him. \"You know what I'm saying? I knew I would get life anyway.\" Superior Court Judge Arnold O. Jones interjected, pointing out that the maximum sentence Stancil faces is the death penalty. \"Yes, I know that,\" Stancil fired back. \"But when I knew what I had to do and I knew when I got caught, you know, I knew in my mind that I could get life, I could get the death penalty. You know what I'm saying? Do you follow my topic? I would have killed you, you know what I'm saying, if you're a f---ing child molester.\" The judge told him not to swear. \"I don't give a f--- what you want,\" Stancil said, lunging forward and lifting up the table in front of him. Deputies quickly corralled him and hustled him from the courtroom. The hearing resumed about 25 minutes later, when Stancil was brought back into the courtroom, this time with his arms handcuffed behind him. When asked again by Jones whether he wanted a lawyer, his response was quick -- and calm. \"Yes, sir,\" he said. In an interview with CNN affiliate WRAL, Stancil described himself as a neo-Nazi and said he hates gay people \"with a passion.\" Stancil had worked for Lane, the school's print shop operator, as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March because of poor attendance, college officials said. During the interview, and during a court appearance in Florida on Tuesday, Stancil said Lane deserved to die, accusing him of being a child molester who'd made advances in online messages to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Lane's family has described those accusations as untrue and slanderous. His cousin, Steve Smith, told WRAL that Lane never made sexual advances toward children or anyone with whom he worked. He described him as a loving man who was dedicated to family and friends. \"Yes, Ron was gay.

Joshua Quincy Burns, formerly of Brighton, was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse earlier this month. Joshua Burns and and his wife, Brenda Burns, say he is innocent, and that he grabbed their daughter Naomi's face when she slipped from his lap as he ended a phone call with his wife in March 2014.\u00a0He claims he was trying to save her from hitting her head on a coffee table in their home. His now-one-year-old daughter suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages. But the couple call\u00a0it 'an accident', not child abuse. Scroll down for video Joshua Burns (right) was sentenced to\u00a0three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse after his daughter Naomi (in his arms) suffered several injuries. He and his wife Brenda Burns (left) maintain Joshua Burns's innocence Brenda Burns has refused to allow social workers and Michigan's Department of Human Services to see Naomi, according to the Livingston Daily. She was not charged criminally in the case, and a civil jury - when the state was seeking to end parental rights - found Brenda Burns not accountable for Naomi's injuries. The couple started a website called TornFamily\u00a0in hopes of raising awareness of their situation and reunite their family. They will also be sharing their story on an episode of Dr Phil on Monday, and Joshua Burns maintains his innocence throughout the episode. 'I never abused my daughter,' he claims in the preview for the show. Joshua Burns claims he never abused little Naomi, and she suffered injuries after she slipped off his lap while he was ending a phone call with his wife and in an attempt to save his daughter from hitting her head on a coffee table he grabbed her by the face Brenda Burns (right) has fled from Michigan to Colorado with Naomi in an attempt to escape being watched by DHS. Their oversight has been put on hold until a June hearing where Joshua Burns's parental rights will be determined After the incident, baby Naomi suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages 'Then why are you in jail?' Dr Phil asks in return. Brenda Burns claims that a Child Protective Services worker and five police officers entered their home and searched her house when the incident occurred. 'I literally thought: Do you have the right family?' she said to Dr Phil. Brenda Burns's attorney Elizabeth Warner said that the mother has the right to not be monitored by the government, and 'certainly not by the agency that takes children' because she was not held responsible for the injuries and is seen as 'the fit parent' Earlier this month, Judge Miriam Cavanaugh said the DHS's supervision of Naomi would continue but is on hold pending the decision as to whether or not Joshua Burns will continue to have parental rights, according to the Free Press. Joshua Burns continues to claim he's innocent. In an episode of Dr Phil airing Monday, he says, 'I never abused my daughter' Even though her husband has been jailed, Brenda Burns supports her husband and agrees that the incident was 'an accident', not child abuse Brenda Burns fled to Colorado to avoid being watched DHS, which she believes is unconstitutional. Naomi's court-appointed attorney has reportedly seen the child and says told the Livingston County\u00a0Circuit Court that the baby is doing well. Warner, Brenda Burns's attorney, said that Naomi is 'doing very well' and that 'she's pretty advanced for her age'. She said: 'You can see pictures of a sick child with tubes in them and think she's going to be brain damaged forever. 'In fact, if this was a misdiagnosis as we think it was, I think the fact Naomi is so well really supports the parents' position this wasn't abuse. It was a misdiagnoses by a doctor. 'It's something she recovered from.' The hearing over the potential termination of Joshua Burns's parental rights is in June.

Or so says actress Patsy Kensit, who made the comments in an interview with this week's Stylist magazine. Miss Kensit, 47, appeared in the magazine's regular 'Queen of Everything' feature and said the Duchess of Cambridge would be her 'regal inspiration'. Feminist icon: Patsy Kensit says the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette' Charity work: The Duchess is famous for philanthropy but not, until now, feminism She added: 'She's so fabulous on every level. She repeats outfits, which is brilliant. I know it's a shallow thing to say but I think it's done so much for women. 'I'm not going to be forced to have to look different every time I go out. She's like our generation's suffragette.' This is the first time that the Duchess, who spends much of her time doing charity work, has been lauded as a feminist icon. Although she has won plaudits for her dedication to children's charities such as The Art Room and Place2Be, her demure dress sense and closeness to her family has resulted in some criticism. Most recently, novelist Margaret Atwood revealed that she thinks Kate is an 'uneventful dresser' who is no match for Princess Diana. Suffragette: Emily Wilding Davison is pictured throwing herself in front of the King's horse in 1913 Votes for women: Campaigners lobbying for votes for women became known as suffragettes Critics: The Duchess was dubbed a 'machine made princess' by Hilary Mantel and 'drab' by Margaret Atwood \u2018I think she\u2019s watching her back,' continued the 75-year-old author. 'I think she probably has people who pretty much tell her what is appropriate for her to wear. 'I don\u2019t think she\u2019s become the fashion plate that Diana was, and I think she\u2019s probably doing that advisably, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u2019 Miss Atwood isn't the only writer to criticise the Duchess, who is due to give birth to her second child later this month, in public. Double Booker Prize winner and Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel has described Kate as being like a \u2018shop window mannequin\u2019 and a \u2018machine-made\u2019 princess who has been \u2018designed by committee\u2019. Meanwhile Sandi Toksvig caused outrage when she said the Duchess doesn\u2019t have a \u2018single opinion\u2019 of her own, while Joan Smith produced a similar storm by labelling Kate \u2018unambitious and bland\u2019.", "candidate_sentences": ["Actress Patsy Kensit says the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette' First time the Duchess has been hailed as a feminist icon.", "She has been criticised for her demure dress sense and closeness to her family.", "Margaret Atwood said the Duchess is an 'uneventful dresser' and 'drab'"], "candidate_words": [["Actress", "Patsy", "Kensit", "says", "the", "Duchess", "of", "Cambridge", "is", "'our", "generation's", "suffragette'", "First", "time", "the", "Duchess", "has", "been", "hailed", "as", "a", "feminist", "icon."], ["She", "has", "been", "criticised", "for", "her", "demure", "dress", "sense", "and", "closeness", "to", "her", "family."], ["Margaret", "Atwood", "said", "the", "Duchess", "is", "an", "'uneventful", "dresser'", "and", "'drab'"]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

The law, signed by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback on Tuesday, bans what it describes as \"dismemberment abortion\" and defines as \"knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus.\" Supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step, while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur, but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy. The law allows for the procedure if \"necessary to protect the life or health of the mother,\" according to a statement on Brownback's website. On Twitter, Brownback, a Republican, said he was proud to sign a law \"protecting life at its most vulnerable stage.\" Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move, which it described as the latest in a series of \"extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability.\" \"Kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the U.S.,\" the advocacy group said in a Facebook post. Both sides appear to be prepared to take their battle over such measures to other states -- and to court. Carol Tobias, the president of National Right to Life, said in a statement that the Kansas law was the first of what her organization hopes \"will be many state laws.\" \"This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States,\" she said. Julie Burkhart,  CEO of Wichita-based South Wind Women's Center, said on Twitter that the signing of the law marked a sad day for Kansas and the United States. \"This law puts women at risk and ties doctors' hands,\" she said. \"We'll continue to fight!\" CNN's Sam Stringer contributed to this report.", "candidate_sentences": ["The law bans what it describes as \"dismemberment abortion\" It defines it as \"knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus\" The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur."], "candidate_words": [["The", "law", "bans", "what", "it", "describes", "as", "\"dismemberment", "abortion\"", "It", "defines", "it", "as", "\"knowingly", "dismembering", "a", "living", "unborn", "child", "and", "extracting", "such", "unborn", "child", "one", "piece", "at", "a", "time", "from", "the", "uterus\"", "The", "law", "does", "not", "spell", "out", "a", "specific", "time", "frame", "that", "limits", "when", "an", "abortion", "can", "occur."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Under the pact, no public holiday is triggered when\u00a0Anzac Day falls on a Saturday, as it does this year. The agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation. That makes Anzac Day the exception when it comes to public holidays. If Easter, Christmas, Australia Day, the Queen's Birthday or Labour Day fall on a weekend, a holiday is granted on a weekday. Scroll down for video Bosses in some states have been warned to expect a rise in employees calling in sick this Monday due to the lack of an Anzac Day public holiday But the rules do not apply to everyone, it seems. Western Australia and some public servants in Canberra have decided to go it alone and will get Monday off. The head of the Immgration Department declared Monday a public holiday for 8,500 staff, but other departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Defence will have to turn up to work. For the rest of the country, it's back to work on Monday. The decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert Paul Dundon warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel 'entitled' to the day off, reports\u00a0Courier Mail. 'Employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off, Australians have an entitlement mentality,' said Mr Dundon, the boss of Direct Health Solutions. 'They're missing out and people want their fair share.' Mr Dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent-25 per cent rise in absenteeism on Monday 27. In turn, some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day, they risk losing their job. In Queensland alone, losses to businesses are estimated at more than $7.5 million if an expected 20,000 workers call in sick. The anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli has fallen on a Saturday this year, meaning all states but WA will miss out on holiday on Monday Australian state governments came together for a Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation. The reason was to avoid 'costs and disruption for business' that occurred when every state had different laws. The states agreed that when Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day fell on a weekend, a public holiday the next working day would be triggered. It was decided that a public holiday for Anzac Day would only be triggered if it fell on a Monday Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday would continue to be observed on the days set according to tradition across the nation. In NSW, the Greens called on Premier Mike Baird to give workers Monday off, claiming the government has the power to grant an additional holiday under the Public Holidays Act. But NSW Business Chamber chief officer Stephen Cartwright told The\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald\u00a0there is no need for another holiday. 'Anzac Day is a very special day for Australians as it commemorates the landings at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915, and we rightly pause and take time to reflect on that day, whatever day of the week it happens to fall on each year,' he said. Punters playing traditional Australian Anzac Day gambling game two-up: NSW Business Chamber officer Stephen Cartwright said there is no need for an additional holiday on for Anzac Day The last time Anzac Day fell on a Saturday was 2009, and before that in 1987, 1992 and 1998.

Charities last night welcomed the move to create a new generation of lifesavers, saying it could prevent hundreds of deaths every year. Previously, only the Liberal Democrats had promised to add the crucial lessons to the school curriculum. But last week Labour, Ukip and the Green Party added their support as they unveiled their Election manifestos. Three more political parties have backed The Mail on Sunday\u2019s campaign\u00a0to add first aid to the curriculum It means the Conservatives are the only major party not to make the same manifesto pledge. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham told The Mail on Sunday that the issue was \u2018close to his heart\u2019. He said: \u2018One of my constituents, a very fit 16-year-old called Daniel Young, collapsed and died on the football pitch ten years ago. It really touched me \u2013 as a parent, the trauma of losing a child in those circumstances is incomprehensible. \u2018Our manifesto pledge is about making sure all children are taught basic CPR skills before leaving school. We want to empower a generation of children, and potentially save hundreds of lives. This is about community resilience and people looking after each other.\u2019 Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham (pictured left) said the issue was \u2018close to his heart\u2019 The Mail on Sunday is campaigning to make sure all schools teach basic first-aid techniques. The skills can also be taught by older children to their younger peers. The campaign has support from Schools Minister David Laws, teachers, doctors and leading charities. Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan believes schools should not be forced to teach first-aid skills as part of an overcrowded curriculum However, Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insists that while first-aid skills are important, schools should not be forced to teach them as part of an overcrowded curriculum. She will instead modernise sex education lessons to include advice on \u2018revenge porn\u2019 and internet safety. St John Ambulance has launched a \u2018promise portal\u2019 to encourage all Election candidates to register their support for the campaign. Richard Fernandez, the charity\u2019s head of public affairs, said: \u2018We have been calling for first aid to be a compulsory part of the national curriculum, so that every child has the chance to learn to be a lifesaver. 'This is a policy that has had backing from individuals in all parties, but it has yet to become reality. \u2018We\u2019re delighted that Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Ukip and the Greens have now adopted this policy and included it in their General Election manifestos.

Triathlete Charlotte Roach, 26, from London, who nearly died in a horror crash, gave up ordinary clothes for Lent to raise money for the charity that saved her life. Along with her business partner Rosemary Pringle, 28, the pair vowed to sport only fancy dress costumes for 40 days to fundraise for London's Air Ambulance. Charlotte Roach and her business partner\u00a0Rosemary Pringle dressed up in different costumes for every day of lent to raise money for the Air Ambulance Service which saved Charlotte after she was involved in car accident in 2010 The two women rated buskers in London's Trafalgar Square while dressed as Simon Cowell, rode the Tube as Baywatch lifeguards and even pitched to clients in their pyjamas. Charlotte, co-founder of fitness company Rabble, owes the charity her life after a crash in November 2010 left her with punctured lungs, 12 fractured vertebrae, broken ribs and a broken collarbone. The fitness fanatic had been out cycling near Melton in Leicestershire in a bid to make the 2012 Olympic triathlete team when her bike collided with a Land Rover. She said: 'When I went down, nobody on my team saw it, so they just assumed I'd taken a tumble and I'd be fine in a minute or two. 'Luckily, the car behind us was driven by a physio for Leicester Tigers' rugby team and she took a look at me. Charlotte continued: 'She could hear a gurgling sound when I spoke, which was the sound of blood seeping into my lungs. Charlotte and Rosemary dressed up as Simon Cowell one day and rated performers in Leicester Square The two women larked about dressed as Reindeer in some shrubbery 'Effectively, I was drowning and I was running out of time to live. Her quick thinking probably saved my life.' Charlotte was airlifted to Royal Derby Hospital, where medics battled to pull her back from the brink of death. She underwent emergency spinal surgery and extensive reconstructive work. Doctors warned she may never walk again, but determined Charlotte worked hard at her rehabilitation. She said: 'In my head I thought as soon as I got home, it would all be okay, but when I got home I couldn't really move. 'I still had holes in my chest that needed to be re-dressed and repacked by doctors every day. Charlotte (left) and Rosemary (right) wore a series of different costumes, here Rosemary is dressed as Harry Potter Charlotte said that the pair had a lot of different reactions, from laughter to confusion The former triathlete said that with some of the costumes it was hard for people to tell whether they were dressed up or not 'One day, despite my mum's protests, I decided to walk to the doctors. My neighbour had to come round to tie my shoes as I couldn't bend down. 'I started walking but had to stop after around 400m. That's when it hit home how little I could do.' Following the accident, Charlotte, who had left university to train as a triathlete full time, was dropped by her former sponsors. 'I wanted to prove I could get back to where I used to be, fitness wise,' she said. 'The less people believed in me, the more determined I became. 'I later found out that, after the accident, doctors called my parents to say I may not survive. I think I was the only person who didn't think I was going to die.' Larking about on a Boris bike Charlotte dressed up as a clown Following her accident Charlotte was left with severe injuries and had screws put into her spine Slowly, Charlotte began to repair herself. While easing herself back into exercise, she stumbled upon the idea for Rabble, a fitness company that disguises exercise as games like capture the flag and dodgeball. 'While I was recovering from my injuries I thought to myself: \"exercise as an adult really sucks.\" It can be repetitive, isolating and boring. 'I wanted to recreate that feeling of playing out with your mates as a kid.' It was the Rabble members that birthed the idea of the fancy dress challenge. 'We were coming up with fun ideas of what to give up for a Lent. A few were chucked around but none really stuck,' said Charlotte. For this costume Charlotte joked about as she was dressed up as a robber The girls went about their daily lives whilst dressed in the costumes, including going to work and going to meetings 'Somebody suggested [giving up] clothes as a joke and at first I thought: 'that's the kind of thing that gets people arrested,' but then we decided to give up normal clothes instead. 'We forget we're wearing costumes until we get weird looks. People do react quite differently. Some laugh, and some almost look disgusted. It depends on the outfit as some aren't obviously fancy dress. 'Our most embarrassing moment so far was meeting with a big, corporate bank in our pyjamas. At first, they wouldn't even let us in the building.' In August 2012, Charlotte cycled 16,000 miles from Beijing to London, raising \u00a310,000 for London's Air Ambulance. Now, she is keen to keep donating. 'I owe the Air Ambulance my life. I wouldn't have survived without them,' she said. 'At the very least I want to donate enough to save someone else life.'

When police arrived on the scene, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to the Arizona DPS According to Facebook, the family is part of a band called 'Matthew 24 Now' (they are also go by 'Busking in the Son' back in Idaho). The name refers to a Biblical passage dealing with the end of times. The remaining members of the Gaver family have been jailed, including an 11-year-old and 15-year-old who were sent to a juvenile detention facility. On duty: Cottonwood Police Sgt Jeremy Daniels, 31 (pictured), was shot in the leg during the attack but is expected to make a full recovery. One of the suspects, David Gaver, was shot in the abdomen but has since been released from hospital The Arizona Department of Public Safety, who are investigating the shooting, said it was sparked when a few members of the Gaver family went into the Walmart to use the bathroom, and one of the store employees followed them into the restroom. At least one member of the Gaver family shoved the female employee, which led to the store calling 911. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days. DPS spokesman Bart Graves says when the police arrived, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to AZ Central. Witness Louie Solano told KPHO that the fight 'looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot'. 'Lots of screams. Just screeching noise, like unreal, unreal,' Solano said. 'During the course of the fight, we believe there was a struggle for the officer's gun,' Graves said. That's when three shots were fired, though it's not clear who had the gun at that point. Sgt Daniels was shot in the leg, while David Gaver was hit in the abdomen. A Walmart employee who came to the aid of police suffered a sprained arm and cuts in the fight. Other officers were treated for lacerations, bruises and a twisted ankle.

Scans revealed a grade two hamstring tear that should keep the 29-year-old out for between three and four weeks but Gomis has been pleased with his progress during the first week of rehabilitation. Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis has been recovering from his hamstring injury in France Gomis is put through his stretching exercises as he bids to play again in two to three weeks Gomis works on strengthening his muscle and has also been able to spend time with his family in Lyon The former Lyon striker took to Instagam on Thursday to share pictures of his recovery as he was put through various muscle building exercises to strengthen the injury. 'Working hard on my rehab to be in shape asap and at home with my family, it seems that things are going better,' Gomis wrote on Instagram. 'I hope that I can go back on the field soon. After all the effort nothing is better than the comfort provided by my little Dione.' The Frenchman will miss league trips to Leicester and Newcastle and the home game with Stoke but hopes to return for the visit to Arsenal on May 11.

The memo for members of Congress states damningly that \u2018the UK may not be viewed as centrally relevant to the United States in all of the issues and relations considered a priority on the US agenda\u2019. Dated April 2015 and drawn up to brief the Senate and House of Representatives on the impact of Britain\u2019s General Election, the memo also warns that the UK faces turmoil if there is a hung parliament. Scroll down for video The 'special relationship' between Britain and the US was strong under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan The document \u2013 prepared by the Congressional Research Service, an in-house intelligence body that gives confidential analysis to legislators \u2013 states that while Britain and the US are likely to \u2018remain key economic partners\u2019, a \u2018reassessment of the special relationship may be in order\u2026 because its geopolitical setting has been changing\u2019. The memo, edited by Derek E Mix, the CRS\u2019s chief European affairs analyst, says that the development of organisations such as the G20 group of major economies has led to a decline in the \u2018influence and centrality of the relationship\u2019. It also states that the UK\u2019s continued importance to the US will hinge on the future success of the economy \u2013 and Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s implementation of spending cuts. It reads: \u2018A significant degree of the UK\u2019s international influence flows from the success and dynamism of the British economy, further raising the stakes on whether the UK can sustain stronger economic growth while continuing to pursue ambitious fiscal consolidation.\u2019 Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama serve food  during a Downing Street barbecue in May 2011.\u00a0When Cameron visited the White House in January, he insisted the President had said the special relationship was \u2018stronger than it has ever been\u2019 Winston Churchill first coined the phrase 'special relationship' in a speech in 1944 The \u2018special relationship\u2019 has been deployed by generations of politicians \u2013 most notably Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher \u2013 to describe the close political, diplomatic, cultural, economic, military and historical relations between the two countries.

Increasingly, however, the relationship has come to be seen as one-sided, with British Prime Ministers more keen to flag up the alliance than US Presidents. When David Cameron visited the White House in January, he insisted the President had said the special relationship was \u2018stronger than it has ever been\u2019.

Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth.

The Prime Minister this morning faced the first serious criticism of the campaign so far, as Tory donors rounded on the party's lacklustre message and failure to pull away in the polls. But a defiant Mr Cameron this afternoon pledged to continue focussing on bread-and-butter issues like jobs, business and childcare. Scroll down for video David Cameron this afternoon hit back at growing criticism over his election campaign \u2013 vowing to carry on warning about Labour's threat to the economy He told supporters in Somerset: 'If you want political excitement. Go to Greece. If you want more showbiz in this election. Go to Hollywood. 'But here and now in the UK I'm focused on something real \u2013 a stronger economy.' Mr Cameron insisted the economy 'excites' millions of people. He said he would campaign on 'more jobs, more homes, more business, more childcare, more security in retirement'. He said: 'I make no apologies for focusing hard on that which is central to everything. When you get a new job, a new home, get a new childcare place or start a new business\u2026 now that's truly exiting. 'And you only get these things with a strong and stable government - not one held to ransom. That's not the excitement 'Britain needs. That's not a risk Britain should take.' Mr Cameron's remarks comes amid claims senior Tory figures are already planning to make Boris Johnson the next leader. Some MPs are prepared to engineer a coup against Mr Cameron in the days after May 7 by submitting letters of no-confidence in him and planning a 'mass show of support' for the London Mayor if the Tories lose, the Sunday Times reported. One major donor, who declined to be named, told the newspaper: 'Boris is the only one who can win. Everyone knows what is going to happen in 10 days' time.

He said the PM needs to raise his game and 'unleash visceral passion and belief in his vision of the future', 'get down and dirty', as well as showing 'he cares', if he is to win on May 7. 'If we don't have a Conservative government after May 7 it will be because of David Cameron. His decision not to keep those Ukip people in the Tory tribe was a key error. 'I see no powerful vision of the future provided by David Cameron. There is no clear considered view of where we are headed.' Mr Hall warned that Cameron's mantra as a sound steward of the economy 'is not enough to win the votes needed to win the election' and added: 'Some people are really quite resigned to losing and they are planning the next step.

The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.'

'We've driven through the mountains, we've been in snow. We've been in the Rocky Canyons, we've seen waterfalls,' said Lindsey, 29.

Their journey came to an end when John's condition worsened and they had to go to a hospice in Grand Junction, Colorado When John died his new wife sat by his side, holding his hand. 'This world will be a much sadder place without John in it,' Lindsey told KHOU11 News. 'The biggest thing that John would want to take away is that there is still love out there,' said Lindsey. Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma is a relatively rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. It affects  lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell - which are found in the blood and in lymph glands. Lymphoma is a disease where lymphocyte B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way. Patients with the cancer experience a swelling in the lymph nodes. If Burkitts lymphoma is in the chest or throat, people can have difficulty swallowing or breathing, whereas if it appears as a lump in the abdomen, it can cause pain, swelling, nausea and diarrhoea. 'Everyone deserves to be loved. You love selflessly, you love with everything you have and he's done that and I've done that and it's made for an incredible story. Something that I will cherish forever.' The pair, began dating in January 2013 after meeting online. But six months into their relationship, John was was diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma. It is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is part of the body's immune system, made up of organs such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes. The rapidly growing cancer started in his leg, but had recently spread to his brain. But after being told the outlook was now bleak, the pair got married at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, where John was receiving treatment. 'My love for you is eternal,' John told his bride in their wedding vows. Lindsey, who has a young daughter from a previous relationship, quit her job as a restaurant manager to help look after John.

Twelve-year-old Alfie underwent a general anaesthetic for an MRI scan at the Animal Health Trust clinic in Newmarket, Suffolk. The pet, who is also completely deaf, had the scan, last month after his owner Lynne Edwards from Huntington in Cambridgeshire, noticed a lump behind his ear. Alfie's owner Lynne Edwards, said she only realised something was wrong with the pet when he started to refuse food and found puss oozing from his back But when Alfie returned from the clinic she realised something was wrong when he started refusing food and found puss oozing from his back. She then took him to a local vet, where staff clipped his fur and exposed the severe burns in his back. Ms Edwards, 64, then discovered that a pad used to keep her dog warm while he had the scan got too hot after it was heated in a microwave. She said: 'I just don't understand how it could have been taken from the microwave and then put directly onto Alfie without it being noticed how hot it was.

The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as \u2018shocking\u2019 evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay, the so-called bedroom tax, and stopped benefits. But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers, which he said were \u2018unverified\u2019, and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work. The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a \u2018political football\u2019. The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks \u2013 said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming, and by critics to show that when free food is handed out, people will always come forward to take it. Yesterday\u2019s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days\u2019 worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604. Its UK director Adrian Curtis said: \u2018Despite welcome signs of economic recovery, hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men, women and children. The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK.\u2019 The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks, with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013-14, when there were 913,138 food bank visits. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust's figures are 'unverified' This figure was almost three times the 2012-13 level of 346,992. In 2009-10 the Trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits. The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three-day food packages, and not numbers of individuals. This means an unknown number make repeat visits, and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million. Research carried out by the Trust, Oxfam, the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks. It found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract. A chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise David Cameron over the figures. Labour\u2019s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: \u2018The shocking rise in the number of people relying on Trussell Trust food banks since 2010 shows the Tory plan is failing. \u2018David Cameron\u2019s failure to tackle low pay, the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid.\u2019 TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u2018This should make all of us ashamed, particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery. It tells us that the Government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net. \u2018Vicious sanctions and benefit cuts \u2013 even for those who paid in all their working lives \u2013 are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident.\u2019 Oxfam poverty chief Rachael Orr said: \u2018It is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the UK.\u2019 The picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected US-based Social Progress Index published earlier this month, which put Britain in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger. Mr Duncan Smith said the Trust\u2019s figures were \u2018unverified\u2019. He added: \u2018We are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory \u2013 whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone. \u2018The best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work \u2013 and we\u2019ve got a strong record there: two million more people in work since the last election. Frances O'Grady, Trade Union Congress general secretary, pictured, described the figure as 'shameful' \u2018It is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it.\u2019 The Oxford Food Bank, which is independent of the Trussell Trust network, urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures. The organisation, which distributes food to other charities which provide meals, rather than handing it out to individuals, said: \u2018We think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon \u2013 whereas food poverty is not. \u2018As an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of Oxford, we adopt a non-political stance. To do anything else would risk disenfranchising a section of that support. \u2018The issue of food banks and food poverty should not be used in a game of political football when the statistical evidence is so potentially misleading. We congratulate the Trussell Trust on the success of their operation but we also believe that successive governments have ignored the issue of waste in the food cycle. \u2018It is high time the OFB model of food bank \u2013 which prevents food being wasted and combats food poverty \u2013 is encouraged and replicated elsewhere.\u2019", "candidate_sentences": ["The Trussell Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks.", "The figures were seized on by Labour and the TUC as 'shocking' But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers.", "He said that the best way to help families was to get people into work."], "candidate_words": [["The", "Trussell", "Trust", "claimed", "that", "1", "million", "people", "are", "being", "fed", "from", "food", "banks."], ["The", "figures", "were", "seized", "on", "by", "Labour", "and", "the", "TUC", "as", "'shocking'", "But", "Tory", "benefits", "chief", "Iain", "Duncan", "Smith", "questioned", "the", "numbers."], ["He", "said", "that", "the", "best", "way", "to", "help", "families", "was", "to", "get", "people", "into", "work."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

The huge rise will be due to a baby boom among Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and African immigrants who usually come to this country during their young, child bearing years. Campaigners fear that this sudden increase will put pressure on housing, schools and the NHS, and worsen the quality of life in Britain as a whole. A baby boom among ethnic minorities in the UK will see numbers rocket by the middle of the century, according to new data, with a quarter of Britons coming from a minority background by 2051 The research, carried out by Leeds University and reported in The Times, shows that overall, between 2011 and 2051, the UK's population will rise from 63.4 million to 77.4 million. While the number of white Britons will increase over that time, by almost three million, the minority population will increase more than three times faster, by 10 million. By the midpoint of the 21st century, minority ethnic communities will make up 24.3 per cent of the total population, compared with 12.8 per cent during the 2011 census. In contrast the proportion of whites will drop from 87.2 per cent in 2011 to 75.7 per cent in 2015. The sudden rise in the ethnic minority population marks an increase on predictions from the same university just five years ago. In an almost identical study, published in July 2010, professors at Leeds University predicted that ethnic minorities would make up around a fifth of the total population by 2051. In the same study they also predicted that British society would become much more integrated, with those from ethnic minorities moving into more affluent areas. Professor Philip Rees, who led the project, said: 'The ethnic makeup of UK's population is evolving significantly. 'Groups outside the White British majority are increasing in size and share, not just in the areas of initial migration, but throughout the country and our projections suggest that this trend is set to continue through to 2051. While the white British population will increase between now and 2051, the minority population will increase nearly three times as fast, meaning they will make up a greater share of the population 'At a regional level, ethnic minorities will shift out of deprived inner city areas to more affluent areas, which echoes the way white groups have migrated in the past. 'In particular black and Asian populations in the least deprived local authorities will increase significantly.' The new research is likely to cause anxiety for those pushing for greater control of British borders, including an in-out referendum on the EU, or a renegotiation of the open borders treaty. While the Conservatives pledged at the last election to cut net migration from 'the hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands', it now stands at just under 300,000 per year. While Cameron has promised a renegotiation of EU laws if reelected, followed by a referendum, the Tory manifesto only contains an 'ambition' to cut current migration. While Ed Miliband has admitted that Tony Blair's Labour government made mistakes on immigration, he has also failed to commit to targets, though he has insisted that all new migrants should be able to speak English. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan also announced yesterday that her department is conducting a review into the pressures that migrants put on schools. That echoes the concerns of researchers such as David Coleman, professor of demography at Oxford University, who said: 'Money of the consequences of large-scale migration are damaging. 'We do not need up to 13 million more people by the mid century. Almost all that increase will be immigrants and their children. It will not make the UK a happier or richer place.

James Boase, landlord of the Coppa Dolla pub in Broadhempston, Devon had been drinking with a friend in Torquay on March 13, 2014. The 36-year-old publican told Torquay Magistrates' Court that the last thing he could remember was going to bed at approximately 12.30am and then awoke beside his car which had been involved in a car crash. James Boase, pictured, failed to stop after hitting another car on March 13, 2014 near his Devon pub, pictured Mr Boase claimed that he went to bed around 12.30am and must have been sleep walking He insisted he had been 'sleep walking'. However prosecutors insisted he had failed to stop his black Nissan Navara after being involved in a collision with a Citroen Berlingo. Police arrived at Boase's house where they found him standing next to his car. He told the court: 'I remember being confused and slightly frustrated.I honestly don\u2019t know how I got there. 'I remember seeing the car and being completely shocked. I believe I must have gone into my friend\u2019s house and gone to bed. 'At the time I was unaware I had any sort of sleeping disorder. 'There were questions unanswered causing me a lot of problems, I was worried and scared and sought medical help to get some answers.' The court heard how Boase had 75 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, more than double the legal limit. At Torquay Magistrates' Court, District Judge Kevin Grey dismissed Boase\u2019s claims of sleepwalking and found him guilty of drink-driving, failing to stop after an accident, failing to report an accident, and driving dangerously.

All eight men were pictured posing with former federal MP Pauline Hanson \u2013 well known for her anti-immigration and anti-Halal stance - at the Brisbane Reclaim Australia event.

Harley Levanic posted an image of a new neck tattoo reading 'Infidel' with the caption 'Who is next boys?'

The Premier League champions have written to 300 fans who took them up on their offer of free transport for the Bank Holiday evening clash at Selhurst Park. Palace's South London home is notoriously difficult to get to and the club acted after the game was scheduled for an 8pm start, making it impossible for supporters to travel by train. Edin Dzeko and his Manchester City team-mates reflect on their Premier League defeat at Crystal Palace Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany looks dejected after seeing his side slump to defeat in London However, after being sent on their way from the Etihad Stadium at 1.30pm by City legend Mike Summerbee, all of those onboard the six coaches missed the kick-off with some arriving as much as 20 minutes after the start. Some complained that Summerbee's send-off had gone on for too long and was responsible for their late arrival. Now, the club has acknowledged the coaches set off too late and have written to supporters to apologise and advise them that they will be refunding the cost of their match tickets. The letter, seen by Sportsmail, reads: 'The free coach travel was provided to enable supporters to attend this match on a day when return rail travel from Manchester wasn\u2019t an option due to the kick-off time, and the time of the final train back to Manchester.

'As a gesture to you and all supporters who travelled on the official coaches, the club will be refunding the money that you paid for your match ticket within the next seven working days. We will contact you if we require any further details to process the refund. 'We would like to apologise for the delayed arrival at Selhurst Park and thank you for your patience and support on the day.' The move is likely to cost the club in the region of \u00a312,000.

A new plane design has revamped the areas where cabin crew can enjoy from rest and relaxation in flight, and it seems they have more space than any passengers. A slick bunk bed design has been unveiled by Zodiac Galleys Europe, giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut-eye during long-haul flights. Scroll down for video First class accommodation! Zodiac Aerospace have revealed their new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew The lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest Drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents, their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious, private and with maximum personal comfort. Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an\u00a0in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system. In order to maximise the sense of space, innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented. The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week, which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing. The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests\u00a0for Airbus A330/A340 since the '90s and is the market leader for this area. Each section boasts a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual  in-flight entertainment systems and air conditioning They aimed to start from a clean slate  in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas, and conducted extensive market research to achieve this. 'The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight, but also to enhance the user experience,' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift. 'In every step of the process users were involved. 'The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests.' Cabin envy! The deluxe areas were created after Zodiac Aerospace spoke to\u00a030 flight attendants from four different continents Last year other rare photographs revealed the tiny space quarters afforded to flight attendants on Boeing 373 Dreamliners. Unlike the Aerospace lower deck areas, the Boeing Crew Rest Departments (CRCs) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane, or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers. Enough room to swing a cat? A file picture reveals the Crew Rest Department on board a Boeing 777 On a Cathay Pacific 777-300ER there is a concealed staircase leading to the CRC at the rear of the plane. Attendants have to duck to get through it, but there is room for eight flight staff with six foot bunk beds with heavy curtains for blocking out noise from other crew members. Instructions state that one crew member can be on a bunk at a time, and never during taxi, take off and landing. When not in use, the secret door must be closed and latched to avoid passengers wandering in.

{"id": "9f2dbe8953dd5b1d2b0f2f748c51bfccbe72906e", "article": "A new sexual technique that aims to teach women how to 'expand the sweet spot' experienced during orgasm has swept into the UK. Orgasmic meditation, shortened to OM, is a practice that marries sex with mindfulness and, according to its founders, encourages 'connection, vitality and wellness' and 'cultivates a greater connection' between partners. The practice, which was founded by US entrepreneur Nicole Daedone, borrows much of its philosophy from yoga and meditation. Director of OneTaste, Justine Dawson (seated on the sofa), is shown guiding a couple through orgasmic meditation, which\u00a0aims to teach couples how to enable women to orgasm more deeply Orgasmic meditation involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption According to teachers of OM, it involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption. The aim is not necessarily to orgasm but simply to 'feel' the sensation as intensely as possible. Usually practiced in pairs, there is a 'strokee' and a 'stroker'.\u00a0OM-ing affects the same parts of the human brain as conventional meditation. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the US in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world.\u00a0There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. There are also 30 dedicated orgasmic meditation centres across the globe. OM can be led in classes or with an individual trainer, if those attending desire a more private setting.\u00a0In the classes, which cost \u00a3195 for a seven-hour session, attendees can be couples or singles. The director of the US company OneTaste, which has brought the sessions to the UK via affiliate company TurnON Britain, says the demographic on classes are surprisingly mixed. Justine Dawson told FEMAIL: 'All kinds of people come to the courses - people in their 20s through their 70s and even into their 80s. She continues: '[It's a mixture of] Singles and couples. Some couples who have been together for a year, others for 30 years. There are all kinds of professional backgrounds - doctors, teachers, programmers, managers, artists, therapists. 'I would say that most people are 25-55, 70 per cent are single, 30 per cent are couples. All who come share a common desire to experience greater connection in their lives.' Your average Brit might find the thought of disrobing in front of others for such an intimate encounter mortifying but Dawson believes that most people can get over the embarrassment if they feel they're gaining a valuable experience. She says: 'When it comes to discussions of orgasm, relationship and connection, I believe that most people are shy. 'But people come to the class regardless, because they know that good things take practice and just like your health or career, it's worth putting time and effort into your sex and relationships, even if it means being a little uncomfortable!' The aim of the \u00a3195 class is to help women prolong the 'sweet spot' when orgasming. There are currently\u00a02,000 people  practicing the method in the UK, according to Turn On Britain Director of US company OneTaste, Justine Dawson, says her aspirations for the practice are that it becomes second nature to mention OM alongside yoga and meditation A video from a private class in London, led by Justine Dawson, shows a woman lying on a towel with a pillow behind her head. She is naked from the waist down and a partner sits on the floor by her side. Dawson, who's been teaching OM for eight years, explains: 'It's a 15 minute partner practice that two people can do together to increase connection, vitality, wellness and to cultivate a greater connection between them. 'A woman takes off her pants and lies down. Her partner sits next to her and lightly and deliberately strokes her clitoris for 15 minutes.' Dawson thinks the attraction for OM is that it offers a more conscious approach to sex and relationships. 'I believe there is a growing trend for the practice because our culture as a whole is ready for something different than the sex and relationships that have been \"on the menu\" up until now. She adds: 'We're ready for a different approach. One that is more conscious. People want information on how to do that. And we offer it openly.' Dawson also leads a team of teachers, holding monthly public sessions of up to 50 people in which couples are shown a demonstration, and then can partake themselves. She says she became an OM teacher out of personal interest: 'As someone who had practiced meditation for many years, I was looking for a wellness practice that would enhance my connection with a partner, while deepening my connection to myself. 'As many wellness practices are done in silence or even solitude, I was curious for one that instead could be done in connection, in a way that would enliven my relationships. I started with a class and it turned into my career, much to my surprise.' She hopes that one day OM will be mentioned in the same breath as yoga or meditation, saying: 'Our vision is that people could equally say yoga, meditation, orgasmic meditation.' Orgasmic meditation founder Nicole Daedone hails from California. Before focusing her attentions on orgasmic meditation, the author and entrepreneur was a University Instructor in Semantics and Gender Communication. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the USA in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world. There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone.

The Samaritan Scandinavians stopped the violence and held the attacker until the NYPD could arrive, the Post reports. Video from the incident shows Kvarzell and Asberg holding the suspect down and trying to calm him down as he screams. 'I can't breath! I can't breath!' he screams. 'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car. Three of the Swedes tended to the aggressor (background) and held him for police, while the fourth stayed with the victim, who had been badly beaten in the fight The Nordic tourists kept both men calm until NYPD cops showed up to sort out the scene The victim had a bloody mouth and seemed to be badly beaten and was not defending himself the Swedes told the Post. One of the officers put the attacker in an arm lock, while two others held him down to the floor of the train. 'One of the guys tried to wrestle us so [we] wrestled him to the floor until the police came,' Kvarzell, 25, who is also an officer, told DNA Info. 'We don't have authority or anything but we thought somebody might need help,' he said.

Stewart, who played in a record 133 Tests for England and is currently director of cricket at Surrey, has not yet been approached by the ECB. But he said: \u2018When England come calling, you shouldn\u2019t say no.\u2019 The early bookies\u2019 favourite for the post is Michael Vaughan, the former England captain who is close to the incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, and has also made clear his desire to help English cricket out of its current state of chaos. Alec Stewart stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday Stewart lines up with Surrey players for the team photo at the KIA Oval Test matches: 133 Highest score: 190 Runs: 8463 Centuries: 15 Half-centuries: 45 Batting average: 39.54 Stumpings: 14 First test: West Indies, Kingston, Feb 24, '90 Last test:\u00a0South Africa, The Oval, Sep 4, '03 Stats via ESPNcricinfo But Stewart, who also spoke highly of the early impression Kevin Pietersen has made on his return to the Surrey team, remains a respected figure in the game. And he is open to offers. Asked whether he\u2019d be interested in the post \u2013 created by the ECB\u2019s new chief executive Tom Harrison, who confirmed Downton\u2019s demise Wednesday evening \u2013 Stewart said: \u2018I can\u2019t just say yes until I know what the role and the responsibility are. But, of course, if it was the right role, you\u2019d be stupid not to look at it. \u2018As a player I did just about anything that was asked of me. If they asked me to take on a role, and it\u2019s the right role, of course I\u2019d listen and have a big conversation \u2013 once the ECB have asked Surrey permission to speak to me, of course, because I\u2019m under contract here. \u2018I just want England to be the best side in the world. And if the ECB felt I was the right person to help take them to No 1, then of course I\u2019d look at it. \u2018I\u2019ve got a big job here, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m concentrating on. But at the same time you\u2019ve got to make yourself aware of other opportunities, and when England come calling, you shouldn\u2019t say no. \u2018If they want someone with experience of being a director of cricket, then I\u2019d have thought I\u2019d be very close to being at the top of that list.\u2019 Stewart (centre front) poses in the Surrey team photo ahead of the start of the County Championship season Stewart was a wicketkeeper-batsman for England. Here he looks on as Australia's Steve Waugh plays a shot towards England fielder Graham Thorpe in the fifth test of an Ashes clash at Edgbaston in 1993 Stewart is carried by team-mates Steve Harmison (left) and Andrew Flintoff, after playing his final Test match, at the Oval in September 2003 against South Africa But Stewart made clear he\u2019d be interested in the job only if there was a clear definition of his accountability. \u2018If you do well, you get patted on the back, if you don\u2019t do well, you get moved on. To me, it\u2019s straightforward. But if there are too many bits and pieces in the jigsaw, people can hide. \u2018I\u2019m not one for hiding. It\u2019s about making tough decisions, and living and dying by those decisions. And making sure the players play without fear.\u2019 Stewart, who led England in 15 Tests and scored nearly 8,500 runs, was effusive in his praise of Pietersen, whose chances of a surprise England recall increased from highly unlikely to merely improbable following the sacking of Downton \u2013 who in turn had sacked Pietersen over a year ago. Kevin Pietersen will feature for Stewart's Surrey outfit in this year's county championships and the former wicket-keeper batsman believes the 34-year-old could still make a comeback at international level \u2018We\u2019ve never had a problem with him,\u2019 said Stewart. \u2018I\u2019m sure other dressing-rooms may not say the same, but we don\u2019t have to handle him. \u2018He fits in well. When he walked in, he went to his locker straightaway: it was like he\u2019d never been away. We can only speak in glowing terms of him. And that\u2019s how I judge people, is how I find them \u2013 not hearsay, or from other people. \u2018England have said he\u2019s not on their radar. But you should never say never. If he\u2019s racking the runs up, and England are struggling, if the players aren\u2019t getting runs or there\u2019s an injury to a batsman, and he\u2019s in top form \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t you want to bring him back?\u2019", "candidate_sentences": ["Alec Stewart has expressed his interest in becoming the new Director of England Cricket following the sacking of Paul Downton.", "The former wicketkeeper-batsman played in a record 133 Tests for England and is currently director of cricket at Surrey.", "The early bookies\u2019 favourite for the post is Michael Vaughan, the former England captain."], "candidate_words": [["Alec", "Stewart", "has", "expressed", "his", "interest", "in", "becoming", "the", "new", "Director", "of", "England", "Cricket", "following", "the", "sacking", "of", "Paul", "Downton."], ["The", "former", "wicketkeeper-batsman", "played", "in", "a", "record", "133", "Tests", "for", "England", "and", "is", "currently", "director", "of", "cricket", "at", "Surrey."], ["The", "early", "bookies\u2019", "favourite", "for", "the", "post", "is", "Michael", "Vaughan,", "the", "former", "England", "captain."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

The silver car that hit Mr Zhang on his motorbike when he pulled out of the junction sped away from the scene without stopping. A driver who witnessed the accident tried to chase after the car but eventually lost it in traffic.

But Defoe was the hero on Sunday as his 20-yard volley proved enough to secure a fifth straight victory for the Black Cats over Newcastle. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe believes his stunning volley against Newcastle has proven his worth Defoe's superb first-half strike was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Sunderland in the Wear-Tyne derby Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was completely helpless as Defoe's shot found its way into the top corner The 32-year-old was overcome with emotion in the wake of his brilliant blast, and admits the joy it brought to a sold-out Stadium of Light was too much to take in. 'I have said many times that I missed the Premier League and it's because of games like this,' he said. 'Games like this are why I came back. Being at a club like this, they just love football. I was told before that if I come here and work hard and score goals, they won't ask for anything more. 'And I just love scoring goals, the fans deserved it. It's been really difficult for them in the last few weeks but they always turn out. 'It was the whole occasion really that got to me. It was great to be the person that made so many people happy. I was just thinking, 'Why me?'. 'As the whistle went for half-time and as I was walking down the tunnel I thought, 'I'm crying and I'm on the telly', but I didn't care. For the fans and everyone it was just a special day.' The victory was the first of Dick Advocaat's reign and moved Sunderland up to 15th. Defoe has compared the feeling of scoring the winner against Newcastle to scoring at the World Cup Defoe added: 'The manager said to use beforehand that we were lucky to be playing in a game like this. 'There are so many young kids who wish they could play in a game like this. To be blessed enough and to score the winner is amazing. 'Going on the bus towards the game and seeing everyone outside the hotel, wanting autographs and pictures, there were so many fans there that I felt, 'Wow, this is a massive game'. 'When I scored I got that same feeling as when I scored in the World Cup. I missed the World Cup in 2006 when I felt in my heart I should have gone. 'It hurt me when I didn't go but I went to the next one and when I got the goal (against Slovenia) I was emotional. 'That was scoring in a World Cup for your country. It was the same on Sunday.'

Mason, who was jailed for 15 months in November last year, has said he will pay back the whole \u00a3185,000 out of his RBS pension pot. The bank has already refunded the customers targeted by Mason, and will receive the money as compensation. \u2018The benefit was \u00a3185,000 and the recoverable amount is greater than that so the available amount will be the same\u2019, said prosecutor David Hughes. \u2018The loser here ultimately was RBS - they had to reimburse the account holders.\u2019 Mr Hughes said the bank had started civil proceedings against Mason, as well as the compensation claim that comes after a criminal conviction. \u2018If he makes a payment from his pension pot to RBS then that would deal with these proceedings and they would come to an end.\u2019 Mason, who sobbed in the dock as he was jailed, did not appear in court for today\u2019s hearing. Judge Stephen Kramer QC will confirm the money has been paid at a short hearing on May 15. At his sentencing hearing, Andrew Lawson, representing Mason, said the bank manager turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting with British troops in Afghanistan. Mr Lawson said that all of the stolen money was paid into his gambling account and told the court: \u2018It was late night poker and online games that are designed to tempt you into spending money in the hope of a big win.\u2019 The court also heard statements from two of Mason\u2019s victims, Julie Amos and Leslie Pilditch, who both said they no longer felt able to trust banks. Julie Jeffrey also described how she lost her job after her arrest and added: \u2018I no longer feel proud, my life has fallen apart.\u2019 Mason's actions took place at Natwest in Biggin Hill (pictured). The bank manager was said to have turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting  in Afghanistan Elaine May, the current manager of the NatWest Biggin Hill branch, also said in a statement that the thefts had \u2018an ongoing impact within the community\u2019 and put strain upon the staff. Mason continues to live in the area with his wife and son and has been working in a local newsagents. The judge, Mr Recorder Simon Farrell QC, told him: \u2018You stole roughly \u00a3185,000 over a period of a year from nine victims who were all elderly and undoubtedly vulnerable. \u2018Your fellow worker Julie Jeffrey, who was falsely arrested because you used her ID details to steal the money, described how, having worked for NatWest since the age of 16, losing her job as a 50 year-old woman and being reduced to delivery leaflets in all weathers. \u2018Plainly these are very serious offences which everyone agrees cross the custody threshold. \u2018You are of previous good character and someone who has suffered considerable personal tragedy. \u2018Your wife suffered from cancer in 2005 and your son at only 19 went to Afghanistan to fight for his country and was the victim of an improvised explosive device that caused him very serious injury. \u2018I accept this caused you to develop a serious gambling addiction which was in fact the root cause of stealing the money from customers. \u2018In my judgement I am afraid these matters are so serious that I am not able to suspend the sentence. The best I can do is to pass a sentence of 15 months imprisonment. But for your personal mitigation this sentence would have been far longer.\u2019 Mason, of Flamborough Close, Biggin Hill, pleaded guilty to a single charge of fraud.

No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars. Lisa Lai told the Daily Camera newspaper she avoided hitting a crash in front of her and ended up propped against a highway barrier \u2014 and out of the way \u2014 as other peoples' vehicles piled up. A tow truck driver works to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36, Friday near Boulder, Colo. A car is stuck under a semi tractor trailer at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup  on U.S. Highway 36 Numerous crashes and spin outs on icy and snowy highways have closed portions of several interstates and highways in the Denver and Colorado Springs area as well as the mountains 'My car was just sitting there on this little island on its own,' she said. 'It was pretty surreal. I feel pretty lucky today.' In Aurora, near Denver, one person died after being thrown from an Oldsmobile Bravada that lost control and rolled on an icy stretch of Interstate 225, striking a passing public bus. The only person on the bus was its driver, who wasn't hurt. Another person in the Oldsmobile was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, police said. Near Fort Carson, the Colorado State Patrol responded to a series of rush-hour crashes involving a total of nearly 20 cars. In the mountains, Interstate 70 was temporarily closed after several trucks spun out on snowy Vail Pass. At lower elevations, the storm left only light snow on grass, and roads were largely clear because of recent warm weather. However, motorists driving at normal speeds were surprised by icy patches, especially on bridges, said Trooper James Schmidt of the Colorado State Patrol. 'We're in Colorado. We have four seasons in one day,' Schmidt said after the sun emerged. A tow truck driver works to clear the scene of cleanup on the pileup  on Drivers of damaged cars wait at the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup No serious injuries were reported in the crashes on U.S. Highway 36 between Boulder and Denver, but tow-truck drivers were kept busy hauling away damaged cars And drought-weary Californians, who can't expect much encouragement from mountains elsewhere in the West: Snow that fills the Colorado River is lagging, too, officials said Friday. The snowpack in the Colorado and Wyoming valleys where the river originates now ranges from 51 to 79 per cent of normal, said Brian Domonkos, Colorado supervisor of the U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey, which monitors snowfall and water availability. The Colorado River supplies water to about 40 million people and 6,300 square miles of farmland in seven states, including California. A driver stands amid vehicles involved in an accident on wrecked cars The Rocky Mountain snow that melts into the river doesn't flow directly to California and other downstream users. Instead, it's held in a series of reservoirs that release enough water to fulfill the legal allotments to southwestern states under a series of agreements and court rulings. The reservoirs have sufficient water to provide California and other downstream states with their full shares this year and for the foreseeable future, said Matthew Allen, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the reservoir system. California also gets water from the Sierra Nevada range, where the snow cover was the lowest it has ever been in 65 years of record-keeping as of Wednesday. Warm temperatures and scarce snowfall in early March caused the snowpack in Colorado to shrink significantly. 'To see the decline that we saw at the beginning of March, that is abnormal,' Domonkos said. 'And to see it continue almost unabated, almost to now, that's quite abnormal.' Emergency personnel and tow truck drivers work to clear the scene of a multi-vehicle pileup A storm brought up to 11 inches of snow on Thursday and Friday to parts of the Colorado mountains and foothills, but much of it fell east of the Continental Divide and will eventually melt into the South Platte and Arkansas rivers. Preliminary readings showed the snowpack on Friday in the South Platte basin was 87 per cent of normal and 79 percent of normal in the Arkansas basin. The U.S. Drought Monitor says 40 per cent of California is in an exceptional drought, the most severe category, and another 25 per cent is in an extreme drought, the second-most severe.

Jerry Brown ordered mandatory, statewide water cutbacks by cities and towns, aiming for a 25 percent cut in water use. Extreme drought conditions also spread into Nevada and southern Oregon, along with smaller pockets in Utah and Arizona. Milder drought conditions extend across the rest of the West, except for most of Montana and Wyoming. Other states served by the Colorado River are Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Nevada.

A&E consultant Dr Ram Manohar, 38, is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital. David McLachlan, prosecuting, said Manohar offered to help Nurse A with her training on December 23, 2013,\u00a0Liverpool Crown Court heard. He said she knew Manohar and, while in his room, asked for his help to learn about matters including chest X-rays. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any warning Ram Manohar put his hand down her nurse's dress and he put his hands into her bra.' She said he moved his hand around but she had not asked for a demonstration. Nurse A said he later asked her a question about the heart, which she got wrong. She said: 'He smacked me on the bottom quite hard and said to me, \"you bad girl\".' Mr McLachlan said Manohar squeezed her left breast to indicate where her left ventricle was and while discussing breast lumps asked to see her nipple, but she refused. She said the conversation moved onto the femoral pulse. Mr McLachlan said: 'Without any word of warning he put his hand up her dress and down her tights.' Manohar then allegedly touched her inappropriately. Nurse A said he told her 'this type of teaching is only for you' before she left the room 'feeling disgusted with herself'. She later told friends she felt 'violated' before contacting police. Manohar told officers he had known her since working with her at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. He said after a night out she had asked him back to her house, but he had refused. He said she had also asked him on December 12 'to find her a single and smart man because she was desperate'. Manohar said on December 23 she unzipped her top, making him uncomfortable, and followed him around 'like a puppy'. The doctor denied touching her inappropriately and said his office door had been open. He said she had been pointing to different parts of her body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive'. Manohar is alleged to have inappropriately touched the nurses in 2013, while working at Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital (pictured). Nurse A said he groped her breast after she asked him about chest X-rays Nurse B alleged that Manohar touched her inappropriately on July 10 and October 31, 2013. She said the first time she went to A&E because she had pins and needles in her hands and feet. Nurse B said he examined and touched her genital area. However, she said she thought he had been professional and thanked him before he gave her a hug. She said on October 31 she saw him about a 'very bad headache' and he treated her in a dark room, checking her reflexes before touching her genital area. The A&E consultant claims he had been pointing to different parts of Nurse A's body and 'if anybody had grounds to complain it would have been him,' adding 'he did not find her particularly attractive' Nurse B again thought he had acted professionally and went to the hospital to drop off a thank you card. She said he invited her to meet him for coffee and she went to the hospital for 'a coffee type date' because she did not know he was married. Nurse B alleged Manohar invited her into his office, kissed her, told her how beautiful she was and suddenly without warning put his hand into her knickers. Mr McLachlan said: 'She stopped him straightaway. He told her that he was married with children.' Nurse B also reported him to the police. Manohar told officers he did not inappropriately touch her during either examination. He said she told him she had feelings for him but he said he was married and she started crying. Manohar admitted he then kissed her but said he did not think he had put his hand into her knickers. He said: 'I think she caught my hand and put it on top of her trousers or something.' Manohar, of Barnston, Wirral, denies four counts of sexual assault. The trial continues.

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher\u2019s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick\u2019s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel\u2019s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction. 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions.'

Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks The TSA called the incident deplorable. \"These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,\" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. \"All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable.\" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim.

The six, whom authorities described as friends who met secretly to plan their travels, are accused of conspiracy to provide material support and attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The complaint says the men planned to reach Syria by flying to nearby countries from Minneapolis, San Diego or New York City, and lied to federal investigators when they were stopped. Scroll down for video Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, and\u00a0Adnan Abdihamid Farah, both 19, and their four co-accused\u00a0have been described as close friends who met secretly to plan their travel to Syria Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19, and the five other men arrested have been accused of being 'intent' on joining ISIS Charged are Mohamed Abdihamid Farah, 21; Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19; Abdurahman Yasin Daud, 21; Zacharia Yusuf Abdurahman, 19; Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19; and Guled Ali Omar, 20. 'These were focused men who were intent on joining a terrorist organization,' Minnesota U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said at a news conference Monday. The six were arrested Sunday in Minneapolis and San Diego and are scheduled to make initial appearances in federal court on Monday. They are the latest people from Minnesota to be charged in an investigation stretching back months into the recruitment of Westerners by IS. Authorities said earlier that a handful of Minnesota residents have traveled to Syria to fight with militants in the past year, and at least one has died. Three of those charged in the newest complaint - Mohamed Farah, Abdurahman and Musse - were stopped at a New York City airport in November along with 19-year-old Hamza Ahmed, but they were not charged until now. Ahmed was indicted on charges of lying to the FBI during a terrorism investigation, conspiring to provide material support to IS, and attempting to provide material support. He has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, the FBI announced the arrest of six Somali-American men from Minnesota, accused of trying to join ISIS. Above, FBI Special Agent Richard R Thornton details the arrests at a press conference, with U.S. Attorney Andrew M Luger to the left Despite being stopped already, Luger said, the three others continued to try to get to Syria to join IS 'by any means possible.' The complaint describes several interactions some of the men had with Abdi Nur, a Minnesota man charged previously with conspiracy to provide support to a terror organization. The complaint says Nur, 'from his locale in Syria, recruits individuals and provides assistance to those who want to leave Minnesota to fight abroad.' The complaint relies in part on material from a confidential informant who had himself conspired to join IS before he changed his mind and went to authorities. Some of the informant's conversations with the six men were recorded. The Minneapolis area is home to the largest concentration of Somali immigrants in the U.S. Since 2007, more than 22 young Somali men have also traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to join the militant group al-Shabab. Omar's older brother, Ahmed Ali Omar, was among those who joined al-Shabab, leaving Minnesota in December 2007, according to the complaint. Ahmed Omar remains a fugitive. It also said when agents went to the younger Omar's house after he was stopped in San Diego in November, another brother, Mohamed Ali Omar, threatened them.", "candidate_sentences": ["Six Minnesota men have been charged with terrorism in a criminal complaint unsealed Monday.", "They are the latest Westerners accused of traveling or attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group.", "The six, whom authorities described as friends who met secretly to plan their travels, are accused of conspiracy to provide material support.", "The complaint says the men planned to reach Syria by flying to nearby countries from Minneapolis, San Diego or New York City, and lied to federal investigators when they were stopped."], "candidate_words": [["Six", "Minnesota", "men", "have", "been", "charged", "with", "terrorism", "in", "a", "criminal", "complaint", "unsealed", "Monday."], ["They", "are", "the", "latest", "Westerners", "accused", "of", "traveling", "or", "attempting", "to", "travel", "to", "Syria", "to", "join", "the", "Islamic", "State", "group."], ["The", "six,", "whom", "authorities", "described", "as", "friends", "who", "met", "secretly", "to", "plan", "their", "travels,", "are", "accused", "of", "conspiracy", "to", "provide", "material", "support."], ["The", "complaint", "says", "the", "men", "planned", "to", "reach", "Syria", "by", "flying", "to", "nearby", "countries", "from", "Minneapolis,", "San", "Diego", "or", "New", "York", "City,", "and", "lied", "to", "federal", "investigators", "when", "they", "were", "stopped."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Pat Ingles, 69, remembers her grandmother sitting by the fire knitting in a pinny and slippers. In comparison, the retired hairdresser, prefers to dress up in kinky outfits and go out drinking until the early hours. Pat, 69, pictured left in her police woman fancy dress outfit, enjoys pole dancing with friend Julia, 67, right 'I really enjoy myself, I party hard,' she admitted on the Channel 5 show OAPs Behaving Badly. 'I have heard of the saying \"grow old gracefully\" but I don't understand it.' Grandmother-of-three Pat lost her husband 12 years ago to prostate cancer after dutifully caring for him during the last nine years of his life following his diagnosis. Now she's focused on enjoying herself and wants to make the most of the time she has left. She said:\u00a0'I have cared for people all my life. I don't want to look after someone full-time again, I want to look after me now. 'Whatever time I have left I am going to party and love it till I die.' Pat in another of her risque outfits gets to grips with an Elvis impersonator in Menorca While Pat likes to hit the town at night, during the day she hits the gym and also enjoys pole-dancing lessons. Thanks to keeping fit and active, she says she feels confident about her appearance as she nears 70 and as a result, she is happy to show off her body in a number of 'kinky' outfits. Her wardrobe includes a risque fancy dress police woman look, air hostess and French Maid outfits, as well as a leather jumpsuit, and she teams them all with\u00a0stilettos. She said: 'I like to dress sexy, if I can't walk in high heels, I won't go outside. I just like to have fun and feel good in whatever I wear. 'For my age I don't have a bad body. I can walk into a room and I still turn heads and I like that.' Pat, pictured again with the Elvis impersonator, loves to party and stay out dancing on tables Far from being embarrassed by their party pensioner grandparent, Pat's family think she's great fun and love it if she joins them on nights out. Her granddaughter, Paris, 20, said: 'She stays out till 1am dancing on the tables, it's not embarrassing, I don't think \"my nanna shouldn't do that\", it's cool.' Pat isn't alone in her desire to party. She has a partner in crime in her friend Julia Church, 67, who now lives in Menorca. Julia, also a retired hairdresser, moved to the Spanish island with her husband and now parties with her fellow British expats following his death seven years ago. Pat regularly visits her and the pair get glammed up for nights out where they drink and dance the night away. Pat on a night out with Julia, left, who says 'we'll just keep going till we fall to bits' The friends often party all night in Menorca where Julia now lives Julia said: 'You can't judge others like us, we're not normal, we're crazy. Being 67 or 27 it doesn't make any difference, we're exactly the same. 'I don't like the thought of getting old, we'll just keep going till we fall to bits. There's no point worrying about it, you'll make yourself depressed.'

Marie Teresa Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against a raft of misconduct charges, choosing not to show up at her fitness to practise hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). She also declined to send a lawyer in her place. The panel has been told Ms Ratcliffe accepts 77 allegations relating to her care and treatment of 14 patients at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital in Cumbria between February 2004 and September 2013. Former midwife Marie Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against 77 misconduct charges at a fitness to practise hearing in front of the Nursing and Midwifery Council. She worked at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital where Joshua Titcombe, pictured, died at just nine days old They include the allegations that, in relation to two babies - one of whom died in February 2004 and another in September 2008 - Ms Ratcliffe's conduct 'contributed to the death' of, and/or caused the patient's baby 'to lose a significant chance of survival'. The allegations against Ms Ratcliffe also included claims she failed to adequately monitor patients, record key observations in patient notes or request assistance from doctors. Amanda Hamilton, representing the NMC, read out a letter written by Ms Ratcliffe which said that she will 'regret what happened for the rest of my life'. Ms Ratcliffe told the panel she is no longer a midwife, and has no intentions of returning to the profession. In the letter read to the NMC panel, sitting in Stratford, east London, Ms Ratcliffe said: 'I am a human being of good will and I accept that I have made mistakes and apologise to those affected by them.' In the letter, Ms Ratcliffe said she felt 'it was important not to delay' proceedings any further or efforts for people to look in to what happened by 'defending myself against these charges'. She denied being part of any cover-up or collusion of what had happened or effort to 'conceal the truth'. In March, an independent investigation into what happened at Furness General Hospital between 2004 and 2013, found failures led to the avoidable deaths of 11 babies and one mother Marie Ratcliffe is the first of eight midwives accused of misconduct and poor care at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Foundation Trust to appear before the NMC. In March, the independent inquiry into the failings at Morecambe Bay, led by Bill Kirkup, found failures at the trust led to the avoidable deaths of at least 11 babies and one mother. Feuding medics, an obsession with natural childbirth, and a tight knit group of midwives who dubbed themselves 'The Musketeers' contributed to a 'distressing chain of events' which led to avoidable harm to mothers and babies, at Furness General Hospital in Barrow, Cumbria. The independent investigation into serious incidents at the hospital between 2004 and 2013 uncovered a series of failures 'at every level' - from the maternity unit to those responsible for regulating and monitoring the trust which runs the unit. The report slammed the clinical competence of staff, a 'them and us' culture between midwives, obstetricians and paeditricians and an over-zealous pursuit of natural childbirth 'at all costs' by a small group of dominant midwives. It found 'shocking' substandard clinical competence, extremely poor working relationships between different staff groups and repeated failure to investigate adverse incidents properly and learn lessons. And the report suggests that when babies died, midwives conspired to cover up the failings. In total eight midwives who worked at the trust could face disciplinary action. The NMC said last year that four midwives should face hearings. Meanwhile another four midwives are still the subject of further investigations. She noted that the system had been flawed but that she was governed by those procedures. She stated that 'in writing these words I seek no leniency' adding 'I accept things I cannot change.' Panel chairman Gary Leong said: 'By her letter Ms Ratcliffe is aware of the proceedings. 'She has voluntarily absented herself. She is very clear that she does not wish to defend herself against these charges. 'In light of that the panel considers that an adjournment would not change the circumstances. She does not wish to come.' He said the hearing is a matter of public interest, and as such will continue today. The proceedings will hear from two of the women who were under the care of the former midwife when they lost their baby. The hearing was told about the first incident occurred in 2004 in relation to the mother referred to a Patient A. Ms Hamilton, for the NMC, said another midwife present at the birth said the baby 'was placed by the side of Patient A and appeared purple, blue and lifeless'. The baby was taken to a specialist unit in Liverpool Women's Hospital where it died on February 26, 2004. The second death of a baby occurred in September 2008. Other allegations she faces in regards to the Patient B's baby include a failure to record or observe maternal blood pressure and that she failed to adequately monitor and/or ensure the foetal heart rate was normal. The misconduct hearing, which is expected to last a month, will hear from several witnesses including the two patients who lost their children. The hearing heard that Ms Ratcliffe qualified as a midwife in 1990 and in 1997 she was promoted to a Band 7 Midwife at Furness General Hospital, part of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, where she worked until January 2014.

After deliberating for 11\u00bd hours, jurors found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on Wednesday of all 30 counts he faced in the Boston Marathon bombing trial. Seventeen of the 30 counts were capital charges, meaning he is eligible for the death penalty. The trial will next move into a penalty phase, where the jury will hear testimony and arguments from both sides and ultimately be tasked with deciding whether Tsarnaev, 21, will be executed. A look at all of the charges Jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors such as the heinousness of his crimes against mitigating factors such as his family and mental health history, as well as his relative youth. Tsarnaev was 19 at the time of the bombing. The start date of the penalty phase has not yet been set. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. \"He was there,\" Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but many say the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Tsarnaev lawyer keeps hated criminals off death row Clarke tried to convince jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. After the verdict, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said Clarke now faces an uphill battle. \"Because No. 1, he (Tsarnaev) is almost functioning as an officer of a military organization attacking the United States -- the claim of course that he's an Islamic radical and that this is almost an army-like attack on civilians. \"And the second thing -- it was so well planned and so callously planned so that civilians would die, so that children would be maimed. And all of this, she has to get around and convince the jury he's not worthy of the death penalty. \"Boy, she's climbing the Mount Everest of death penalty cases in this case,\" Callan said about Clarke.

Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. \"We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries,\" Enck said. \"You definitely want to wash them really good. \"This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant,\" Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. \"It's not something that you would have any warning of,\" Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated.

The case marks the first time that the Franklin County prosecutor\u2019s office has charged an adult with molesting children while knowing that he carries the virus that causes AIDS. 'I was outraged when I saw that police report,' Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O\u2019Brien told The Columbus Dispatch. O\u2019Brien said Allen had access to the two 12-year-old girls because his girlfriend is related to one of the children and the other sometimes spent the night with them. The assaults took place between September 1 and March 22, according to the indictment. Allen has been in the Franklin County jail since his arrest on March 25. His bail was set at $1 million.

Aliesha Peterson, 22, detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs \u2013 and enabled the Alberta, Canada, resident to gain a noticeably fitter, and much more muscular, physique, as well as an impressive six-pack. 'I can honestly say I am sooo thankful I started taking better care of myself [sic],' she wrote under her Reddit name ahhhgodzilla. 'My progress has been fairly slow but, to me, the most important thing is that I didn't give up.' Scroll down for video Impressive results: Aliesha Peterson, 22, first started exercising in August 2013, left; as of April 2015, right, she has lost nearly 20lbs and gained a six-pack Aliesha wasn't always a fan of working out - and explained that she didn't start hitting the gym to look better in a bikini, either. 'I was extremely depressed and refusing to go back on anti-depressants,' she explained. 'I went and saw a therapist, and she recommended that I join a gym and start working out three times a week. 'I reluctantly obliged and to be completely honest, I absolutely hated it. 'I hated how uncomfortable I felt there, that I obviously had no idea what I was doing.' But after three months of sticking with it, she admitted that she started to 'somewhat enjoy it'. Aliesha's routine is made up of exercises that focus on a different part of her body for each day of the week, and she will often do cardio on the weekends. Her workouts include several sets of squats, bench presses, crunches, curls, and planks. On Wednesdays, she works on her back, which she said is her favorite part of her body. Her back exercises include deadlifts, hyperextensions, and chin ups. Bringing sexy back: The 22-year-old says her back is her favorite part of her body, and she focuses on exercises to strengthen it every Wednesday 'Before' body: Aliesha, pictured here in 2013 before she started exercising, was by no means overweight, but she has since become more toned by sticking to a demanding workout schedule After about six months, Aliesha started changing her eating habits, too. While she once stuck to an unhealthy diet which included fast food 'at least twice a day', she began cooking her own meals and choosing to eat healthy food. Now, her diet consists of eggs, yogurt, fruit, chicken, seeds and nuts, green smoothies made with vegetables, protein shakes, turkey, and salmon. Aliesha admits that her story isn't one of shocking rapid weight loss - but she says her slow progress is the reason she's been so successful. 'I'm sure if I completely changed my lifestyle all at once that my results would have been a lot more impressive in a much shorter amount of time, but it would not have been sustainable,' she wrote. Because she's worked at a slow, steady pace, she's been able to maintain her new figure - which has been a boon to her self-esteem. 'I am much more confident in my body,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'I no longer hate looking in the mirror and have learned to accept my flaws and am able to see the positive qualities I possess as well.' Barely-there biceps: In October 2013, pictured, Aliesha had only just started going to the gym to help her improve her depression Welcome to the gun show: Pictured this month, Aliesha's arms have grown much more muscular; she says she now loves going to the gym Of course, Aliesha added, it isn't always easy to maintain the motivation to work out five to seven days a week, but sticking to a routine has helped. 'I truly believe the key to bettering yourself is to cultivate and preserve healthy habits,' she continued. 'The first few months are the hardest, but once you make it through that stage it becomes a lot less painful, and you may even learn to enjoy it like I have.' She is also enjoying what working out has done for her mental health. 'While I still struggle with depression, it is much, much less severe,' she said. 'Instead of laying in bed all day crying, letting it consume me, I get up and do things - go to the gym, do yoga, walk my dogs, see friends. 'The best part of getting into this routine has definitely been the mental change,' she concluded.

With tickets at the sold-out Emirates starting from \u00a364 for the 12.45pm kick-off, protesters hope the image of empty seats around the ground will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs.

It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word \"genocide\" to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes.

Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. \"The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence,\" he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues.

Sarah Watson, 34, had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender at a Christmas party for the team. But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort \u00a3100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her \u00a325,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare. Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle. In one, she is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of an unknown white power in Las Vegas. In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots\u00a0San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight. The 34-year-old had met Rojo at Manchester United's private Christmas party in a Manchester bar. She said the footballer had approached her and complimented her looks and dress.\u00a0Despite calling his approach 'cheesy', she had decided to give him her phone number. Later that evening\u00a0Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. 'My love, where are you?' he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's \u2013 known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit \u2013 made a shocking proposition. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers. She was depicted in court \u2013 and in the national press \u2013 as a scheming blackmailer who demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about the affair.

Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model And it was on this basis that the player's lawyers obtained a High Court order preventing her from speaking out. \u2018People who look after Marcos claimed I had demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about our encounter,\u2019 she said.. \u2018But it was a lie and they knew it. They tried to trap me.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t set out to do a kiss and tell, but the chance to make some money to pay for my personal training course was very tempting. I\u2019m a single woman and I had not done anything illegal or that I was ashamed of. '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me \u00a3100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated \u00a325,000 legal costs.

It is understood a teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in Birmingham\u00a0where extremist Islamic views were being forced on pupils and staff. This includes allegations an al-Qaeda style video featuring masked gunmen was copied in a classroom and teachers punished pupils by making them kneel on tiles. More than 50 teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged as many as 3,000 messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby was a hoax. Scroll down for video Park View School in Birmingham was one of the schools placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism - up to 100 teachers are now being investigated It is understood the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) - the profession's watchdog responsible for banning teachers from classrooms - is looking at 30 disciplinary cases, with an expectation many more teachers will be targeted for their part in the affair. The probe into the Islamic plot last year found evidence of anti-Western rhetoric, intolerance towards gays and creating the perception of a worldwide conspiracy against Muslims. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Allegations under investigation include claims that an al-Qaeda style video was copied at Park View Academy and teachers punished children by making them kneel on the floor, the Sunday Times reports. A group of teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group where they claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby and the Boston bombings, where two bombs were set off at the finish line of the city's marathon, were a hoax. Professional hearings are set to begin next month. More than 50 teachers alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich,  was a hoax In his report, Peter Clarke (pictured) found there had been a 'coordinated, deliberate and sustained action' to introduce an aggressive Islamic ethos in the schools The teaching watchdog has obtained 'dossiers' about some of the 100 staff it is investigating from the Department for Education as part of its inquiries. They are understood to include information from last year's Trojan Horse probe headed by Peter Clarke, the former head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard. His report, published in July, found there had been a 'co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action, carried out by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos into a few schools in Birmingham'. It also highlighted a 'disconcerting pattern' in the schools, including nepotism in staff appointments, bullying of senior teachers, a 'strategy of harassment to oust the head teacher' and the 'reinforcement of Muslim identity to the exclusion or disparagement of others'. A source told the Sunday Times: 'The 100 or so include teachers, teaching assistants and teaching staff. The Department for Education is feeding in information to help corroborate some of what the NCTL has, and, in other cases, flag up new targets.' 'In some cases, some of those teachers and staff are still working at schools, and in other cases they have been removed. 'But although some of them have been removed, the NCTL does not want them to end up anywhere else.' The Trojan Horse scandal started with an anonymous letter in March last year describing an Islamic plot to take over schools in Birmingham called 'Operation Trojan Horse'. The document - now thought to be a hoax - proposed a campaign of installing governors and undermining and then replacing school leaders with staff who would be more sympathetic to their religious agenda. That in turn led to 21 schools being inspected by schools inspector Ofsted, which put six schools in special measures and said five had not done enough to protect children from extremism. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Then in November last year, inspectors found evidence that six independent faith schools in Tower Hamlets, in east London, had an unbalanced curriculum. Several teenage girls have fled to join ISIS in Syria from schools in Tower Hamlets. This Easter, tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed by Tower Hamlets council advising parents to 'lock away' their children's passports if they fear the youngsters may be planning to travel to Syria over the holiday period. Tower Hamlets is the only local authority in London where Muslims account for the largest single religious group.

Meanwhile others say they protect the skin from the inside. But are any of these high-tech suncreams worth buying? Here, Dr Bav Shergill, a consultant dermatologist at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, offers his verdict. And we rate them... A new generation of suncreams promise to protect against the damage from infra-red A rays and others say they protect the skin from the inside. Here, consultant dermatologist Bav Shergill gives his verdict Dr Skin's Suncare Lotion And Sun Drink \u00a311.90 for five 60ml shots and 100ml lotion, dr-skins.com CLAIMS: SPF 30 suncream containing UVA and UVB protection, plus pack of five 60ml liquid food supplement shots - these contain vitamin E, lycopene, vitamin C, beta-carotene and other nutrients for skin health. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'A bit of a gimmick - the concept is you are protecting the skin from the inside out with antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables. 'There's no evidence that drinking this would stop sun damage. 'The suncream is ok, but it's pretty standard.' 5/10 Ladival Sun Protection, SPF 30 \u00a319.99 for 150ml spray, from Boots and supermarkets CLAIMS: First mainstream product to protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB. Also has antioxidants. Offers 'protection against four times more of the sun's rays'. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'The effects of infra-red A rays on the skin is an emerging field of research. 'A recent study suggests antioxidants may stop damage from infra-red A. 'I'd plump for Factor 50 rather than Factor 30 - although some argue this only improves protection by 3 per cent. 'You can get the same UVA and UVB protection from cheaper products.' 6/10 Dr Skin's lotion and sun drink comes with liquid food supplement shots, while Ladival is the first product to\u00a0protect against infra-red A rays as well as UVA and UVB Goldfaden MD Sun Visor Oil Free Spray, SPF 30 \u00a340 for 80ml, Space NK stores CLAIMS: This protects against UVA/UVB rays - it contains titanium oxide, oxtinoxate, benzophenone and organic red tea extract. Developed by a U.S. dermatologist, it is said to be the first over-the-counter sunscreen that is 'physician strength'. EXPERT VERDICT: 'Titanium oxide reflects UVA and UVB rays off the skin, while oxtinoxate absorbs UV rays and converts them to heat, so it doesn't damage DNA - most good suncreams should contain these. 'Physician strength' sounds impressive, but I'm not sure what it means. 'Organic red tea might help mop up the harmful molecules produced as a result of UV exposure. 'It's expensive and I'd opt for a Factor 50 product.' 6/10 Mustela is made from a avocado based ingredient, which 'aids development of the skin's barrier Mustela Very High Protection Sun Lotion SPF 50+ \u00a314.95 for 100ml, from independent pharmacies CLAIMS: Avocado Perseose (a patented ingredient based on avocados, which have a high vitamin E content), aids development of the cutaneous (skin) barrier and preserves the wealth of cells in babies' skin. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This is easily absorbed and free of parabens (preservatives) and fragrance so would be good for a baby's sensitive skin as it won't cause irritation. 'Children are more likely to burn as their skin is still developing. 'Avocado oil is a good moisturiser, but it's not clear how it 'aids the development of the cutaneous barrier'. 'I'd say there are cheaper products that would work as well.' 7/10 Actinica Lotion \u00a319.99 for 80g, larger branches of Superdrug and Lloyds Pharmacies and pharmacy2u.co.uk CLAIMS: For the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients (e.g. those who have a suppressed immune system, such as transplant patients). Protects against UVA and UVB. No SPF listed. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This product was tested for two years on immuno-suppressed patients who are at high risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, because they take drugs which suppress the body's defence cells which also destroy early cancer cells. 'Patients who've already had non-melanoma skin cancers might find it reassuring to use.' 8/10 Wilko Moisturising Sun Lotion SPF 50 \u00a32 for 50ml, from Wilko stores CLAIMS: A UVA and UVB sunscreen. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'This does what it says on the label. 'It has the same UVA and UVB protection ingredients as other more expensive creams, plus it is water resistant, and easily absorbed.' 9/10 Actinica aims to\u00a0prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients while Calypso contains UVA and UVB protection, is water resistant and won't stain clothes Sun Ceutic 50 Anti-Ageing Sun Protection SPF 50 \u00a331 for 50ml, from uniqueskin.com CLAIMS: This is said to prevent photo ageing (sun-induced skin damage) and sun spots and contains a 'powerful stem cell stimulator'; also contains hyaluronic acid, zinc oxide, titanium oxide and aloe vera. EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'All Factor 50 suncreams with UVA and UVB protection should protect against photo damage and sun spots. 'Hyaluronic acid is used as an anti-ageing treatment to restore lost volume in the skin, but there's limited evidence it has the same effect in a cream. 'It's not clear what the 'stem cell stimulator' is.

EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'This is OK for a school situation as children are mainly indoors.

A Chinese team took a kite measuring an astonishing 6,000 metres (3.7 miles) to a kite flying festival - aiming to break the world record by a massive 1,000 metres. But they had overlooked the fact that their kite was so big, it posed a danger to passing aircraft. The kite, dubbed 'centipede with a dragon's head', was set to fly at the Wulong International Kite Festival last Saturday in Chongqing in south-western China, according to\u00a0People's Daily Online. Scroll down for video Flying high: Half of the 6,000-metre-long dragon-themed kite took to the sky in Chongqing last Saturday Skilful: The kite weighs 200 kilograms and requires three experienced kite flyers to\u00a0manoeuvre However, Chinese aviation authorities ruled that the dragon-themed kite - which is made from 2,000 separate pieces and weighs a whopping 200 kilograms - could not be flown, and the team were forced to fly only half of it. The weather at the kite flying festival in Chongqing undoubtedly played a part, with a heavy mist reducing visibility not only for pilots but for spectators who had turned up to witness the annual event. Each of the 2,000 pieces bears the Chinese characters 'China Dream' and it takes eight hours to get the full-length kite airborne. Wang Dongming, one of the three kite flyers, said special sturdier rope made from kevlar - which is also used to make bulletproof vests - had to be used to thread the  kite. Mr Wang said: 'Big kites and kites that are used for trick flying are usually built from this kevlar rope to prevent the line from snapping in the wind.' In order to secure the pieces on the kite, craftsmen only used bamboo that was more than three years old which can resist severe wind. Colourful: Kites of all shapes and shades take to the sky in Chongqing during the four-day-long festival Although the kite did not fly full-length, organisers of the festival still claimed that they had broken the Guinness World Record for the longest kite in the world. The previous record is reported to set by a 5,000m-long kite made by craftsmen in Weifang in eastern China last spring.

Michelle Manhart, 38, was handcuffed by police at Valdosta State University, Georgia, and driven off in a patrol car after grabbing the Stars and Stripes and refusing to return it to the student demonstrators. Video footage of the event, on Friday, shows Manhart struggling with officers, who force her to the ground after she refuses to let the flag go. Scroll down for video Struggle: Manhart, 38, is shown, left, refusing to release a flag which protesters were trampling on. In the right-hand photograph she is seen being arrested at Valdosta State University in Georgia Cause: Manhart came to the campus because she heard students were walking on the flag, as seen above It shows her surrounded by protesters on the campus, who demand their property be returned. In response, Manhart says the flag belongs to 'the entire United States'. Campus police try to convince her to drop the flag, but Manhart, a former training sergeant who served in Kuwait, refuses. Speaking to the Valdosta Daily Times about her intervention, she said: 'I did not want anything like this, but I got a call from a student who told me that the flag was on the ground, and they were walking on it. 'I was just going over there to pick up the flag off the ground. I don\u2019t know what their cause is, but I went to pick it up because it doesn\u2019t deserve to be on the ground.' She continued: 'If your cause is racism then find some white people and walk on them. 'But to walk on the flag is walking on our symbol of freedom. You have the freedom to do what you are doing because of it. I\u2019m not fighting against them. I\u2019m fighting against the way they are going about it.' It is not clear what the demonstrators were rallying against. They did not answer reporters' questions about what their cause was. Air Force to bare force: Manhart was once a Staff Sergeant at the San Antonio Air Force training camp (right), but was demoted when she appeared nude in Playboy magazine. She is shown left holding a copy of the issue containing her spread According to the Daily Times, the group didn't want to press charges against Manhart. However, police gave her a trespass warning, which bans her from the campus. Manhart has come under fire for standing up for her beliefs before. In 2007 she made national headlines - and lost her job - for posing nude for Playboy magazine. Explicit photographs from the periodical's February 2007 issue show then-Sergeant Manhart in a variety of provocative poses - first with, then later without - her military uniform. Cover girl: After her original feature, Manhart appeared in Playboy again. She is shown here on the cover of the Mexican edition When Air Force bosses got wind of the racy feature, they relieved her of her duties at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. She was later demoted, and ultimately left the Air Force. However, she remained defiant, telling reporters at the time 'I didn't do anything wrong, so I didn't think it would be a major issue'. The decision brought an end to 14 years of service She later appeared in other editions of Playboy - including the cover of the Mexican edition - \u00a0and posed for animal rights group Peta to support an anti-fur campaign. The Daily Times reported that Manhart now intends to hold a pro-military counter-demonstration in the town on Wednesday. In response to the incident, the university's president says he disapproves of the flag-trampling protest, but recognizes their right to express themselves that way if they choose.

Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: \"Has she got a baby in her belly?\"' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week. She added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being. 'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now. 'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone. 'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages. 'Now I can spend more time with the kids.' Lizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'. She added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes. 'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done. I'm really pleased, and I believe she will keep it off as she's found a routine that suits her.

Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black.\u00a0Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an \u00c9douard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar FBI investigators have long said they believed organized crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon.

A statement from European football's governing body read: 'The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) met today and announced the following decision in relation to various incidents that occurred during the European Qualifiers Group G match between Montenegro and Russia, which was played in Podgorica on 27 March. 'The CEDB has decided to declare the above-mentioned match as forfeited. As a consequence, the Football Association of Montenegro (FSCG) is deemed to have lost the game 3-0. A flare, hurled from the stands, hit the Russian keeper on the head in the opening seconds of the game Igor Akinfeev is carried off the pitch on a stretcher, which led to an 30 minute delay before play resumed The keeper was carried off the field to hospital for tests before eventually making a full recovery 'In addition, the FSCG has been ordered to play its next two UEFA competition matches as host association behind closed doors. The second match to be played behind closed doors is deferred for a probationary period of two years. Finally, the association has been fined 50,000 euros.'

Manhattan-based\u00a0Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post\u00a0was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I\u2019m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects \u2013 including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video\u00a0Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week 'If I hadn\u2019t had [my friend\u2019s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly\u00a0visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, \"Wow!\"' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently.

Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career. Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer 1. BALL OF THE CENTURY Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting. 2. AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable. 'One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field,' he raged from the Channel Nine studio. 3. LAST SPELL OF COMMENTARY IN ENGLAND Benaud's final commentary duties for Channel 4 came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2005 and was commemorated by members of the crowd waving banners in tribute. 4. 'YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL THERE!' Benaud's  cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour, an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit. 5. ANDREW SYMONDS STOPS A STREAKER Thankfully, Benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between Australia and India. 6. TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP HUGHES Benaud narrated Channel Nine's powerful tribute to Phillip Hughes in November 2014. 7. GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P.S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership.

The latests picture, captured by an amateur photographer as the Colima volcano in Mexico spews out a plume of ash and lava, reveals the raw power of a volcanic eruption. Hernando Rivera Cervantes took the pictures as local authorities warned those living around the volcano, which is also known as the Fire volcano, to prepare for a possible evacuation. Lightning strikes inside the enormous ash cloud thrown into the air by the Colima volcano (above) in Mexico The 12,400 feet (3,800 metre) high volcano, which first erupted in 1576, is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico. Mr Cervantes spent eight hours watching the volcano as it threw ash up to 1.8 miles (three kilometres) into the atmosphere before managing to capture the rare picture. He said: 'I waited for eight hours, knowing something was going to happen. When the lightning arrived it was magical. An unforgettable experience.' These blots of lightning are thought to occur due to the build up of electric charge in the ash cloud as the particles rub against each other. Just like in a thunder cloud, this charge eventually builds up until it seeks a path through to the ground as lightning. This sequence of images captured by photographer\u00a0Hernando Rivera Cervantes show the lightning flashes as the Colima volcano erupted Mr Cervantes also managed to capture this night-time image above of lava spilling from the erupting volcano Small volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years have been protecting the Earth from global warming, according to a recent study. Scientists have confirmed that droplets of sulphur-rich aerosols spewed into the upper atmosphere by volcanoes have been reflecting sunlight away from the Earth. Until recently it was thought that only particularly large eruptions had any noticeable affect on the climate. However, a study published earlier this year has confirmed results from the end of last year that showed these small eruptions can have an accumulative impact on global temperature. This could have helped decrease the global temperatures by between 0.05\u00b0C to 0.12\u00b0C over the past 15 years. Earlier this month scientists discovered that it is this lightning that is responsible for making the glass spheres that can appear in volcanic rocks. They found that the intense heat generated by the lightning bolts causes the ash to melt into spherules of smooth glass. A bolt of volcanic lighting can heat the surrounding air to more than 3,000\u00b0C, according to the researchers from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Dr Kimberly Genareau, a volcanologist at the University of Alabama, said their findings\u00a0suggested that the role lightning plays in volcanic eruptions may be under reported. Writing in the journal Geology, she said: 'We refer to this new morphological classification of ash grains as lightning-induced volcanic spherules (LIVS). 'Observation of LIVS in tephras (volcanic rocks) will provide evidence of lightning occurrence during eruptions where lightning was not directly observed or documented.' The Colima volcano is actually one of three volcanic domes that make up the Colima Volcanic complex in the Mexican state of Colima, 301 miles west of Mexico City. It has erupted around 40 times since its first recorded activity in 1576. There are now around 300,000 people living in it shadow. The volcano has a history of large and explosive eruptions, which has meant it is also one of the most studied volcanoes in Mexico. Although lightning in volcanic ash clouds has been observed for a long time, scientists have only recently begun to understand what causes it. The Colima volcano is regarded as one of the most dangerous in Mexico due to its large explosive eruptions Mr Cervantes (shown above) spent eight hours waiting to capture his stunning images of the Colima volcano Getting close enough to an erupting volcano is dangerous, so scientists at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich recreated volcanic lightning in a lab. In 2013 they suspended volcanic ash gathered from sites around the world in a chamber filled with argon gas, forcing the concoction through a narrow tube. They found that the movement of ash particles against each other as they go from the compressed environment under the Earth's surface into the atmosphere during an eruption causes a built of up static charge. When the ash reaches the atmosphere, the energy is discharged as lightning bolts.", "candidate_sentences": ["Photographer Hernando Rivera Cervantes spent eight hours watching the Colima volcano in Mexico as it erupted.", "He managed to capture the rare images of lightning strikes inside the ash cloud.", "Lightning in volcanic ash clouds has been observed for a long time, but scientists have only recently begun to understand what causes it.", "A bolt of volcanic lighting can heat the surrounding air to more than 3,000\u00b0C, according to a recent study."], "candidate_words": [["Photographer", "Hernando", "Rivera", "Cervantes", "spent", "eight", "hours", "watching", "the", "Colima", "volcano", "in", "Mexico", "as", "it", "erupted."], ["He", "managed", "to", "capture", "the", "rare", "images", "of", "lightning", "strikes", "inside", "the", "ash", "cloud."], ["Lightning", "in", "volcanic", "ash", "clouds", "has", "been", "observed", "for", "a", "long", "time,", "but", "scientists", "have", "only", "recently", "begun", "to", "understand", "what", "causes", "it."], ["A", "bolt", "of", "volcanic", "lighting", "can", "heat", "the", "surrounding", "air", "to", "more", "than", "3,000\u00b0C,", "according", "to", "a", "recent", "study."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

The toddler's mother was holding him and another child when he slipped and fell between 10 to 12ft and into the pit on Saturday around 3pm. The child was rescued by his parents before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. Scroll down for video A mother was holding the two-year-old boy and another child when the toddler slipped and fell into the cheetah exhibit at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo (file photo of cheetahs at the Cleveland zoo) The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital He is listed in stable condition after being taken to MetroHealth Medical Center and suffered from minor bruises and bumps. The boy's leg was injured in the fall, but he was not attacked by the animals, Dr. Christopher Kuhar, the zoo's executive director told Fox 8. Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5.

But Britt McHenry, a Washington D.C.-based sports reporter for ESPN, has been suspended from her position after an ugly and offensive rant she unleashed on a hapless tow truck company employee surfaced online this week. The 28-year-old, who hails from New Jersey, had her car towed from the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant in Arlington, Virginia, and the verbal attack was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office. 'I\u2019m in the news, sweetheart, I will f-----g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying in the video. Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry has been suspended for one week and could face further punishment after video surfaced of her berating an Advanced Towing employee in Arlington, Virginia Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera Glamorous: Originally from New Jersey, McHenry is a sideline reporter for ESPN based in Washington D.C. Pictured is Gina Michelle, the clerk abused by McHenry and told she needed to lose some weight The incident occurred on April 6. The parking attendant can be heard in the video warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. 'That\u2019s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this,' McHenry responds. 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' The parking attendant patiently replies: 'Well lets get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money\u2026with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' She's outta there: ESPN immediately responded by suspending McHenry, but only for one week After a few more comments, including telling the woman she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos' I'm on television and you're in a f-----g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping the bird to the cameras 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?': McHenry, who has impeccable grooming when on-camera, berated the woman for her appearance and her job Video of the shocking scene was obtained by Live Leak. As the video spread online, ESPN were forced to react. A spokesman confirmed McHenry had been suspended, however only for one week. It is unclear whether a more serious punishment will be handed down. Right after the incident took place, McHenry took her Twitter account to rant about how Adanced Towing is 'corrupt'. Not surprisingly, she has since deleted the tweet. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday Do as I say, not as I do: McHenry's words of wisdom earlier this year On Thursday, she turned to social media again to apologize for her actions, saying it was an 'intense and stressful moment' for her. She posted online: \u00a0'In an intense and stressful moment, I allowed my emotions to get the best of me and said some insulting and regrettable things. As frustrated as I was, I should always choose to be respectful and take the high road. I am so sorry for my actions and will learn from this mistake.'

He had performed most recently in Istanbul on Valentine's Day. The performer, who was also an accomplished guitarist, was first diagnosed with cancer in 1990, the year he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the year before he released the album that ignited his career. The cancer returned in 2005 and then again in 2014, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. He died Friday in a hospital in Istanbul, five days after his 66th birthday. \"We are in grief over losing Kayahan, who contributed to Turkish music with countless compositions and marked a generation with his songs,\" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu tweeted. The singer, whose full name was Kayahan Acar, was born in Izmir province, in western Turkey on March 29, 1949. He grew up in Ankara, Turkey's capital, before moving to Istanbul. In 1990, he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, finishing 17th. The following year he released an album titled \"I Made a Vow,\" which catapulted him to prominence. Though he recorded nearly 20 albums, that one would remain his most popular. His final album was released in 2007. Other artists recorded his material throughout his career. Videos available online show a vibrant performer with a thick shock of dark hair as he accompanies himself on guitar and croons in a clear tenor. Kayahan was best known for his love songs.

Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings. With figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese, Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure. Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world. Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table, put together by a Harvard Business School academic, looking at a range of living standards Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world Despite national earnings that make us the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a \u2018social progress index\u2019 suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers \u2013 for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: \u2018Overall, within Europe the UK\u2019s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) \u2018The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK\u2019s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.\u2019 The table \u2013 which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world \u2013 lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd. For Press freedom, the UK is ranked 27th. Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, who headed the research, said: \u2018A striking finding is that gross domestic product is far from being the sole determinant of social progress.\u2019", "candidate_sentences": ["Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings.", "Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure.", "Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance.", "This puts Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world."], "candidate_words": [["Obesity", "levels", "were", "the", "main", "factor", "pushing", "the", "UK", "down", "the", "health", "rankings."], ["Britain", "was", "111th", "out", "of", "133", "countries", "on", "that", "specific", "measure."], ["Overall,", "the", "UK", "came", "11th", "in", "the", "table", "of", "countries", "with", "the", "highest", "standards", "of", "prosperity,", "health", "and", "tolerance."], ["This", "puts", "Britain", "outside", "the", "top", "ten", "most", "civilised", "and", "best-off", "people", "in", "the", "world."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Summer Robertson from Shrewsbury died after being overpowered by fierce currents off a picturesque beach in December near Kenton-on-Sea, a small town on the country's south-eastern coast. Miss Robertson was with three other British members of a team that had completed a 10-week charity adventure together with the Latitude youth volunteering group, at a remote camping resort. Summer Robertson, 21, who died after drowning off the coast of South Africa, where she had been helping youngsters in one of the country's poorest townships Miss Robertson's parents Sarah and John have been remembering their daughter who they described as a 'bubbly tomboy' But she soon got into difficulties in the water and died before she was brought to shore. Another volunteer, 19-year-old Alice Barnett, from Canterbury in Kent also passed away after her body was washed up on the beach a day later. Now four months after the incident, her parents John and Sarah, who also have two sons Michael and Sam, have been remembering their daughter, who died while on a trip of a lifetime working with deprived youngsters. Her father Mr Robertson, a 51-year-old works foreman, said he spoke to his daughter on the day she died. He explained: 'I spoke to her that Thursday morning. Summer pictured volunteering in South Africa. The 21-year-old had spoken to her father John just hours before she had died Miss Robertson, left, died alongside fellow volunteer Alice Barnett, right, after they went for a celebratory swim after finishing their volunteering course 'She said everything was great, they had finished their work and were having a few days relaxing before they came home. 'I was due to pick her up on the Tuesday. She contacted us at least once a week and said she was living the dream.' Her mother says she had no worries about her daughter taking part in the trip, but Mr Robertson added he did warn her to stay out of the sea, as she was not a confident swimmer. He added: 'She was only paddling in shallow waters. It's just horribly sad. 'On the night of her death, two policemen came to the door at 11.30, and I knew straight away. 'I knew it was either Summer or our son Sam, who was living in digs in Birmingham at the time while at university. 'As soon as they said Summer's name, I knew something had happened.'

Her mother said: 'It has motivated us to want to do something positive in her memory. 'We've decided to take a leaf out of Summer's book, and not take life so seriously. 'Now I don't mind so much if the phone doesn't work. There's more to life than worrying about work and paying the mortgage. 'That's only stuff, as Summer would say.'

One of the boys was 16 and two were 17 when they were having sex with Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35. One testified that he considered her to be his girlfriend during their yearlong tryst. But the boys were all minors, and Utah law also says a person cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust. Altice could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month. Scroll down for video Guilty: Former Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice, 35, pictured here in court on Wednesday, pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse involving three male students Lengthy prison sentence: Altice accepted the agreement in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. She could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month Altice pleaded guilty to three counts of forcible sexual abuse in exchange for prosecutors dropping 11 other counts, including several first-degree felonies. School officials knew about Altice's inappropriate behavior and didn't do enough to protect the students, the boys and their parents say. In one of two lawsuits filed against the Davis School District, the plaintiffs said the running joke at the high school was, \u2018Who is Ms. Altice sleeping with now?\u2019 Davis School District spokesman Chris Williams said he would love to comment on the allegations but that the civil lawsuit precludes him from saying anything. Prosecutor Susan Hunt said the three victims are on board with the plea deal, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Altice is scheduled to be sentenced May 28. Each count carries a possible sentence of 1 to 15 years in prison. Altice's attorney, Ed Brass, said his client wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial. Brass previously defended Altice, saying she was no longer the boys' teacher when the sex occurred. Altice's attorney said his client, pictured in court back in January, wanted to resolve a case to avoid risking an uncertain outcome at trial Altice was first arrested in October 2013 after a student reported having a relationship with her. Two more victims later came forward with similar allegations. She was out on bail during most of the criminal proceedings until allegations emerged earlier this year that she had sex with the third victim following her 2013 arrest. A judge ordered her to jail, where she's been for the three months. Brass asked the judge Wednesday to let Altice out on bail until her sentencing, but the judge denied the request. Brianne Altice was hired by the Davis County School District in 2004 and had been teaching at the high school since August 2012. She was put on leave from the school after the allegations came to light and later fired in February 2014. She had been ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor, in connection\u00a0to her suspected affairs with three students. In mid-March, one of the alleged victims brought a $647,000 lawsuit against the Davis County School District accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the 'flirtatious' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him. More legal trouble: Two students have filed lawsuits against the Davis County School District in Utah accusing officials of failing to fire English teacher Brianne Altice, pictured in court in January, who is accused of having\u00a0sex with three boys Earlier this month, another student sued the district for hiring Altice, reported The Salt Lake Tribune. Court documents detailed how at times, the students skipped other classes and spent entire days with Altice, sent her text messages and made explicit comments to her. On her part, the 35-year-old Altice confided in her teenage admirers about her martial problems. According to the complaint, the relationship between the woman and the boys in her class eventually turned physical. Similarly to the first lawsuit, the new complaint alleged that the school district was aware of Brianne Altice's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her. She allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on \u00a0bail for charges relating to the first two students. The student who brought the initial lawsuit in March accused the district of being negligent when it hired Altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him. He claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex. He stated that the school district had reprimanded Altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired, the Tribune reported. Despite the claims against her, one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against Altice are 'ridiculous' and 'she doesn't deserve to be here'. In trouble: Altice, pictured at a hearing in February 2014, allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 One of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the English teacher, left, even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students. She was first taken into custody in 2013 He told the court he had sex with Altice once prior to October 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in December, while she was out on bail.

{"id": "9056f691c18f7f0fd4658011b5c5376905c761ad", "article": "When Emma Jackson, 28, moved into a quiet cul-de-sac in Hull just over a year ago, she thought she had found the perfect place to call home. But within a week of moving in, her dream home turned into a nightmare thanks to an aggressive neighbour with a penchant for watching TV with the volume turned up at all hours of the day. Unable to sleep because of the racket, the photography student asked unemployed Mark Ray, 56, to turn it down - but was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated, a year later, in violent threats and stalking. Terrified: Emma Jackson, 28, was subjected to vile verbal abuse and was stalked by her neighbour Now Ms Jackson has been forced to move home because of Mr Ray but says she lives in terror of him discovering her new address. Ms Jackson's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground floor flat, which she did despite having been warned that the previous occupants also had trouble with Mr Ray. 'I was told that the previous tenants antagonised him but I'm obviously not like that so I didn't think it would be a problem,' she said. Then the daily barrage of noise began. 'On the first morning, I was laid in bed and it was about 6am and all of a sudden, there was this noise. 'The TV was on at full blast to the point that you could hear what he was watching. The ceilings are really low so it was right above my bed.' After a week, Ms Jackson approached her neighbour to ask whether he would mind turning the sound down a bit but found herself on the receiving end of an expletive-laden tirade. Aggressive: Mark Ray, 56, waged a year-long campaign of terror against Ms Jackson Quiet: Ms Jackson and Mr Ray were neighbours in this quiet cul-de-sac in Hull 'I got this explosion, this tirade of abuse,' she remembers. 'Then he ran off and went into his flat and I was just totally shocked. It was the first time I'd met him and that's what I got from him.' The noise continued, with Ms Jackson forced to resort to headphones in order to get any sleep at all. Worse still, Mr Ray began to subject her to vile tirades every time he spotted her in the street or over the garden fence. Incensed, Ms Jackson got in touch with the local Housing Association. Although ordered to turn his television down, the 28-year-old says Mr Ray's new leaf lasted for just seven days. 'He kept to that for about a week and then he just crept back up again and it went back to how it was before.' Finally at breaking point, Ms Jackson snapped and banged on the ceiling with a broom handle during a cleaning session. Mr Ray responded by banging on her front door and, when confronted and accused of bullying by Ms Jackson, threw a 3ft wooden pole at her. Damage: As well as threatening violence, Mr Ray nailed the shed door shut (see photo held by Ms Jackson) Traumatised: Ms Jackson says her year of living next door to Mr Ray was the worst of her life As the situation at home worsened, it began to affect all areas of Ms Jackson's life, with Mr Ray even turning up at her workplace. Her family were also affected, with Mr Ray physically threatening her step-mother and father when they visited Ms Jackson's home. 'Mr Ray came out, he was shouting and swearing as usual and red in the face,' she remembers. 'He had a massive rock on top of his bin. 'My step-mum was standing close to the fence and he held it over his head as high as it could go and said \"I'm going to kill you\". 'My dad ran forward and put his hand out to stop it. I was just totally shocked and I feared for my step-mum's life. If he'd have dropped it on her, he would definitely have killed her.' The police were called and Mr Ray was handed an injunction that prevented him from approaching or speaking to Ms Jackson. But even that wasn't enough to stop him. 'I think he was scared for a bit and didn't want to get into any trouble,' she says. 'But then his actual personality must have got the better of him because he started again a few weeks later. 'Instead of overtly harassing me, he would follow me down the street. You could hear it was him because of his stick. 'Everywhere I went, he turned up, he was there. It made me feel really paranoid because every time I walked down the street, I could feel his eyes on the back of my head.' By now at her wits end, Ms Jackson says every part of her life was suffering. 'It was affecting everything in my life,' she says. 'It was affecting my studies because I couldn't sleep. It was affecting my work because I had everything going on at once and it was just ridiculous. 'My hair started falling out because I was just that stressed about it all.' Eventually, Ms Jackson installed a CCTV camera and was finally able to gather the evidence she needed to prove Mr Ray was breaking the terms of the injunction. In October 2014, he was issued with a new injunction that said he would face immediate arrest should he become violent or threaten it. But for Ms Jackson, it was too little, too late and she has now moved into a new home away from Mr Ray. 'It's been the worst year of my life,' she says. 'I've been depressed. It's affected my relationships with people. 'I don't want him to find out where I live [now] because I'm sure he would do something. He is that type of person and that does scare me.'", "candidate_sentences": ["Emma Jackson, 28, moved into a quiet cul-de-sac in Hull just over a year ago.", "But within a week of moving in, her dream home turned into a nightmare.", "Mark Ray, 56, had a penchant for watching TV with the volume turned up.", "Unable to sleep because of the racket, Ms Jackson asked Mr Ray to turn it down.", "But she was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated in violent threats and stalking."], "candidate_words": [["Emma", "Jackson,", "28,", "moved", "into", "a", "quiet", "cul-de-sac", "in", "Hull", "just", "over", "a", "year", "ago."], ["But", "within", "a", "week", "of", "moving", "in,", "her", "dream", "home", "turned", "into", "a", "nightmare."], ["Mark", "Ray,", "56,", "had", "a", "penchant", "for", "watching", "TV", "with", "the", "volume", "turned", "up."], ["Unable", "to", "sleep", "because", "of", "the", "racket,", "Ms", "Jackson", "asked", "Mr", "Ray", "to", "turn", "it", "down."], ["But", "she", "was", "met", "with", "a", "barrage", "of", "abuse", "that", "culminated", "in", "violent", "threats", "and", "stalking."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.' Cardiff City Supporters Club Chairman Clive Francis said, 'Cardiff City Supporters Club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the Football Club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups. 'The \"bad old days\" of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of \"fans\" have thankfully been left far behind us now. This is now reflected in the respectful treatment received from the majority of clubs we visit.

The spacecraft  that lost contact with flight controllers will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in about a week, Roscosmos, the Russian Federal Space Agency, said Wednesday. \"Roscosmos (the Russian Federal Space Agency) announced that the Progress will not be docking and will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere,\" Kelly said from the space station. The Progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between May 5 and May 7, according to Roscosmos. The Progress vehicle does not present any danger to the International Space Station due to a significant difference in orbit, Roscosmos added. The Russia space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the ISS and expects to launch a new Progress ship in the third quarter of this year. Russia lost contact with ISS Progress 59 during a resupply mission to the International Space Station. The ship is now spinning out of control, NASA said. Even if Russia hadn't lost contact with the craft, the original plan was for Progress to burn up re-entering Earth's atmosphere -- albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station. According to NASA information on the Progress resupply vehicle, \"After the cargo is removed and before the Progress undocks, the crew refills it with trash, unneeded equipment and wastewater, which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.\" The cargo spacecraft launched successfully early Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. But after it separated from the Soyuz booster rocket's third stage, Russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft's systems, including the deployment of navigational antennae, NASA said. \"The spacecraft made another pass over Russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system,\" the American space agency said in an update. A planned rendezvous with the ISS six hours later was initially postponed to Thursday but has now been canceled, NASA said in its latest update. \"Docking has been called off for the Progress 59 spacecraft,\" it said. \"Russian flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be. Additional information will be provided as it becomes available.\" Few details have been forthcoming so far from Roscosmos. According to NASA, the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food, fuel, oxygen, spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station. But the hitch will not put the six ISS crew members at risk, NASA said. \"The spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the United States Operating Segment (USOS) of the station,\" a statement said. \"Both the Russian and USOS segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight.\" That next flight, which will be the seventh SpaceX commercial resupply services mission to the space station, is not scheduled  to take off before June 19, NASA said. Meanwhile, Russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with Progress 59 as it passes over Russian ground stations. NASA said Tuesday that Russian flight controllers had \"confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it.\" According to Russian state news agency Tass, six attempts to make contact were to be made Wednesday. The U.S. supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station's environmental control and life support system, backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing, \"all of which are replaceable,\" NASA said.

Ben Elton took a swipe at Myleene Klass over her criticism of Ed Miliband's mansion tax plans, at the event also attended by Eddie Izzard, Joey Essex and Sally Lindsay. The comedian told a 1,000-strong crowd at Warrington's Parr Hall the popstar - who claimed the planned levy on homes worth more than \u00a32 million would hit 'little grannies' - had made her money 'showering in a bikini' and should be 'proud to make a contribution'. Elton, who distanced himself from the party under Tony Blair, told supporters he was 'back with Labour'. He said: 'It's no secret that I am now one of that wealthy minority. Me and Myleene Klass. Scroll down for video Comedian Ben Elton, left, took a swipe at Myleene Klass, right, during a rally for Labour supporters The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex posed for a selfie with a fan during rally in Warrington 'I made my money cracking knob gags, she made her money showering in a bikini. 'We should both be proud to make our contribution.' Elton lashed out at the glitzy Black and White fundraising ball staged annually by the Conservatives to raise funds. 'Apparently we are the ones that sneer. Really? Have you seen the Black and White ball? 'Just a little bit of sneering going on I think.' Long-time Labour supporter Eddie Izzard said the party would offer a 'fair chance for everyone'. Actress Sally Lindsay told the crowd 'it makes me sick' that people are having to turn to foodbanks because they cannot afford to eat. The former Coronation Street star backed Labour's plans to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts and called for a 'decent minimum' wage. Coronation Street actress Sally Lindsay joined Justine Miliband and Eddie Izzard at the campaign event Joey Essex was among the crowd at the rally where Ed Miliband announced a \u00a35 billion Future Homes Fund 'That's why I'm voting Labour, that's why I support Ed.' Martin Freeman, one of Britain's most bankable Hollywood stars, was the first celebrity face to back Labour's 2015 General Election campaign. Joey Essex, who posed for selfies with excited fans, was attending the event ahead of interviewing all the party leaders for a TV special. At the rally in Warrington, Ed Miliband told supporters a Labour government would 'get Britain building again'. Announcing a \u00a35 billion Future Homes Fund, he said Labour would build 125,000 new homes. In a speech, he said: 'There's nothing more British than the dream of home ownership. Starting out in a place of your own. But for so many young people today that dream is fading.' He went on: 'Our plan is the first real plan for housebuilding in a generation. 'We will build at least 200,000 homes a year by the end of the Parliament. 'We won't let those large developers just hoard land. 'Waiting for it to go up in value when it could be used to build homes. 'We'll say: either you use the land or you lose the land. 'We will build a new generation of towns, garden cities and suburbs creating over half a million new homes. Ed Miliband, speaking at the rally, \u00a0said a Labour government would 'get Britain building again' 'We will make housing the top priority for additional capital investment.'

Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state \u2013 let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah \u2013 especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later. Alshammari's attorney Ron Yengich declined to comment on Tuesday, saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest. When asked about Alshammari's connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege. Police did not offer details about the royal connection, besides saying that federal officials reported Alshammari is related to royalty and has family connections to the Saudi Arabian government.", "candidate_sentences": ["Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents.", "He was arrested on Friday at the Mexican border and is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February.", "He has not yet entered a plea to those charges."], "candidate_words": [["Monsour", "Alshammari,", "27,", "is", "in", "the", "U.S.", "on", "a", "Saudi", "government", "student", "sponsorship", "and", "has", "ties", "to", "the", "country's", "royal", "family,", "according", "to", "court", "documents."], ["He", "was", "arrested", "on", "Friday", "at", "the", "Mexican", "border", "and", "is", "set", "to", "be", "extradited", "back", "to", "Utah", "where", "he", "faces", "charges", "related", "to", "the", "rape", "of", "a", "student", "in", "February."], ["He", "has", "not", "yet", "entered", "a", "plea", "to", "those", "charges."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

In a country where a significant majority of citizens live in poverty, the self-styled Mirreyes (my kings), with their champagne and sports cars, are increasingly exposing the amount of wealth concentrated into a relatively small number of hands. Mirreyes, which refers to individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' and are 'placed above all others', post pictures of luxuries with a hashtag of the same name. Scroll down for video Ballers and shotcallers: Mirreyes are often the sons and daughters of the members of Mexican high society Laying out and living it up: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes showcase luxurious vacation spots It's just one big fiesta: A glance through the social media profile of a Mirrey often reveals a party picture Bling: Good clothes, nice watches and a flashy style are almost prerequisites for becoming one of the Mirreyes Ready for takeoff: An expert on the subject of Mirreyes said 'the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts' Three for the money:\u00a0Mirreyes' displays of wealth can  lead to political and legal advantages down the road They are often the sons and daughters of government officials, wealthy businessman and other members of Mexican high society and although their displays of wealth can be embarrassing, they can also lead to political and legal advantages,\u00a0Maclean's\u00a0reported. One such individual, the eldest son of then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a cruise ship off the coast of Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and vanished without a trace, Before he jumped off the ship's 15th floor and disappeared beneath the waves, 29-year-old Jorge Alberto L\u00f3pez Amores told his friends to take cellphone videos of his leap. He said: 'I'll stop this cruise, I'll make history.' L\u00f3pez got his wish as the boat stopped for two hours to search for him, according to Vivelo Hoy. His story is not the only example of the celebration of excess gone wrong. In 2012, the\u00a0daughter of oil workers' union boss Carlos Romero Deschamps was brought into the spotlight for posting photos of her luxury lifestyle, including Gucci bags and expensive wine, on Facebook. Her flashy pictures did not sit well in a country where people work an average of 2 226 hours a year and households take in an average of $12,850 per year after taxes. Their stories are just examples of what the author of a book about Mirreyes called the Mexican 'Generation Me'. Keeping time: People often post pictures of watches and other luxuries like designer bags and or alcohol Rought: In Mexico, the images of wealth are shocking as households take in an average of $12,850 per year Symbol: Jorge Alberto L\u00f3pez Amores (right), who likely died after jumping off a boat, is an example of a Mirrey Purchasing power: Mirreyes might not even think twice about spending hundreds of dollars on a stuffed bear Selfie star: L\u00f3pez, the son of\u00a0then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a yacht in 2014 No need to pimp my ride: Mirreyes obtain cash from sources like inheritance, theft, corruption or the lottery Kiss the bling: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes will either have a shiny watch, fancy champagne, or both The author of Mirreynato, the Other Inequality,\u00a0Ricardo Raphael, wrote in his book: 'The economic wealth Mirreyes use is the main marker of class. 'No matter where the money comes - work, inheritance, theft, corruption or lottery- the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts'. By identifying themselves as Mirreyes on social media, these seemingly spoiled brats are possibly creating connections which could be important for business and politics in the future because money attracts powerful friends. They are certainly being noticed. In 2011, a \u00a0a website called Mirrreybook was created by Pepe Ceballos. He began posting photos of mMirreyes on the site and it quickly became popular. Ceballos said: 'Mirreyes, who don't have anything to do with narcos [narcotics traffickers], seem like they're competing with them to see who has more. 'We've suddenly seen it in the kind of fashion or the bling-bling. There's more influence from the narcos.' In a recent source of embarrassment, Mirreyes were also featured in a controversial video that showcased the class of 2015 from private school Instituto Cumbres in Mexico City. In the professionally-produced video, well-dressed male students were shown drinking alcohol while carrying out a casting call with young women who dance, strip and wash their feet. Popping bottles: Mirreyes are individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' The flash and the not-so-furious: Members of this select group seem to have few reasons to be upset with life Up in smoke: Some Mirreyes post photos implying they have something in common with narcotics traffickers Look at me: The selfie has become somewhat of a status symbol and Mirreyes frequently use them to show off Future endeavors:\u00a0By identifying themselves on social media, Mirreyes are possibly creating good connections The all-male  Catholic school was accused of sexism and promoting privilege after the video began to spread across the internet, according to the\u00a0National Catholic Reporter. The school issued an apology late last month. It said: 'The Cumbres Institute Mexico asks for an apology for the content of the video that offended various persons, who have expressed anger. 'This video in no way represents the values and principles of the school, students, families and graduates. ''The necessary measures are being taken with the students involved and to establish rules so that it does not occur again.'

May Pat Christie, 51, a managing director at New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co, ditched her $475,000-a-year position this week, a family spokesman confirmed. The official reason for the resignation was 'to spend more time with her family and young children'. But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return. He later tried to clarify his comments by saying 'we have four children to raise and a lot of things to do' - but many pointed out that he still easily sits in the wealthiest 1 per cent of his home state.", "candidate_sentences": ["May Pat Christie, 51, quit her $475,000-a-year job at Angelo Gordon & Co.

The barbaric footage, released earlier today, shows the men kneeling in the middle of a dusty road in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, as a militant brandishing a sharpened sword stands behind them. It comes just one day after the extremist group claim to have shot and beheaded more than 30 Ethiopian Christians in Libya. Each of the men are forced on to their hands and knees in the war-torn street before they are beheaded The harrowing video shows the sword used to kill the men being forged and sharpened for the executions The three men were accused of being Assad agents, working for the Syrian governmment, say ISIS The new eight-minute video shows the men - wearing orange Guantanamo-style jumpsuits with their hands and feet in chains - sitting in a dirty, underground room. After giving information about each of the prisoners in Arabic, the men are blindfolded and filmed in the back of a moving van while an ISIS militant decked in black guards over them. When the van stops, the barefoot captives are escorted out and begin to march slowly down an abandoned street, surrounded by fighters holding guns. The professionally-shot film pans the scene - showing buildings irreparably damaged by bombing - before phasing into a picture of the executioner's sword being sharpened before the brutal executions. One by one the prisoners are beheaded by a fighter, who is dressed completely in black and unidentifiable. Their bodies are left on the road. Initial reports suggested the extremist group targeted the men because they worked for the Syrian regime. But they did not confirm who the men - thought to be aged between 35 and 45 - were or when the execution took place. The prisoners were filmed barefoot and in shackles in an unknown prison at the start of the sick video They were then blindfolded and transported in a van to the execution point - thought to be\u00a0Deir ez-Zo in Syria Sparks fly from the sword as it is sharpened, before being used to behead the men in a brutal execution One by one the men are murdered. The body of one of the men can been seen after he was beheaded It is the latest footage released by the militant group, which is increasingly using propaganda to encourage would-be jihadi fighters. Yesterday a 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive in Libya. It showed at least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', being shot in a desert area while 12 others were beheaded on a beach. In February a similar video was released showing the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya. The helpless men were kept under a close watch by their ISIS captives. Videos of this nature - often professionally shot - are used by the militant group as propaganda to attract other would-be jihadi fighters The bodies of each of the helpless men, thought to be aged between 35 and 45, were then left on the road One of the victims, flanked by two fighters in black, can be seen being led down the abandoned Syrian road ISIS has taken over large sections of iraq and ISIS and carried out multiple public executions similar to this The battle against Islamic State amid a protracted civil war in Syria is thought to have already claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people. ISIS has destroyed churches and Christian shrines in the country. They also demanded that Christians living under its rule pay a 'special tax' known as jizya.

The 2005 Ashes winning captain is the hot favourite on the three-man shortlist compiled by the ECB at Thursday\u2019s management board meeting ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart, who have both registered their interest. Vaughan spoke with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison for an hour and has worked closely in the past with chairman-elect Colin Graves at Yorkshire and looks set to be offered the job if he can reach agreement. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket Vaughan spoke to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No 1 choice Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday \u2018I had a good chat with Tom which was just about general stuff,\u2019 said Vaughan. \u2018We had a one-hour conversation. I have not got a clue what the role is, what the parameters are or what they are looking for. \u2018It was the first time I have met him since he was made chief executive because I\u2019ve been away at the World Cup. I knew him from his IMG days and back in the day when he played for Derbyshire but we had not met in person for a long time,\u2019 Vaughan told the Daily Telegraph. \u2018It was just a chance to meet up and have a chat and try to kick around a few ideas. It was away from England stuff. It was about the game, the structure and Twenty20. Everything. \u2018I like the way he works and his vision for the game and he and Colin Graves will be the perfect partnership. But nothing has changed as far as I\u2019m concerned. I am keen to talk to them when I understand more about the role and what skills are required. 'There will be many others, really good guys, keen to talk who are the type of guys needed to move English cricket forward. \u2018I am certainly not in a position to be anywhere near being appointed because I don\u2019t know what the job is. Until we know what it entails I, like all the other candidates, have to look at it and see whether it is for me.\u2019 Former England stars Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role That may be so but the ECB are keen to make a quick appointment and Vaughan looks certain to be the one they want to effectively become a football manager type figure with overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Peter Moores, who is preparing to coach England in their Test series here in the Caribbean, said on Thursday he could work with Vaughan even though the pair had an uneasy relationship when they were captain and coach in 2007. Vaughan has also been a strong critic of Moores in his second coming as coach in his various media roles and it is the amount of successful interests Vaughan has that remain the biggest obstacles towards his appointment. \u2018I am loving my job at the moment,\u2019 said Vaughan. \u2018I really enjoy the media work and I am now looking forward to getting to the West Indies to watch England win a series they should win and continue where they left off in Test cricket against India last year.\u2019 It will be fascinating to watch Vaughan commentate for BBC\u2019s Test Match Special on a team he may well soon be in charge of. England coach Peter Moores has said he could work with Vaughan despite their uneasy relationship Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket Alec Stewart (Age 52) CURRENT JOB: Director of cricket at Surrey. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Played 133 Tests, more than any England cricketer. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Has established a rapport at Surrey with the out-of-favour Kevin Pietersen \u2014 says English cricket needs to be bold. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He\u2019s only interested if there\u2019s a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Andrew Strauss (Age 38) CURRENT JOB: Sky commentator. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Widely respected within English cricket for taking the team to the top of the Test rankings. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: Strauss is still in the early days of his career as a commentator \u2013 and is enjoying it. Michael Vaughan (Age 40) CURRENT JOB: Broadcaster and columnist. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Famously led England to the 2005 Ashes \u2014 and 26 Test wins overall, a national record. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Joe Root is a particular favourite \u2014 he is next in line to replace Alastair Cook as Test captain. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Vaughan is interested in the job in principle, and is close to incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves.

{"id": "7344a9b120b339c394c3f905cbc1097096de9b2e", "article": "The pursuit of journalists for paying public officials was in ruins last night after prosecutors dropped a raft of cases. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the \u00a320million \u2018politically-motivated witch hunt\u2019 turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists \u2013 Operation Elveden \u2013 was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said \u2018enough is enough\u2019, adding: \u2018It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.\u2019 The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain\u2019s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers\u2019 cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office \u2013 under which prosecutions were brought \u2013 had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists \u2013 news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt \u2013 still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials \u2013 including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff \u2013 charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday\u2019s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was \u2018remarkable\u2019 that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured \u2018two years of torture\u2019. He added: \u2018I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It\u2019s a disgraceful waste of public money.\u2019 The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O\u2019Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest. Mrs Saunders said the original police inquiry was \u2018inevitable\u2019 and left prosecutors with a \u2018duty\u2019 to act.

Now, 18 months later, Lawrence tells ABC that little Wil 'brings a light to our family.' He said he once believed having a child with Down Syndrome would put limits on what he and his family could accomplish. Instead, Lawrence said, little Wil has taken the limits off and 'opened so many doors' for his family In return, the father of five has taken the limits off the child and given him a one-of-a-kind ability. The ability to fly. Scroll down for video 'Wil Can Fly:' A Utah photographer, Alan Lawrence (left), created a photo series in which his 18-month-old son, Wil (right), who has Down Syndrome appears to be flying The father created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly' in which the toddler appears to be flying in many different scenes. Lawrence, who began taking the photos when Wil was just months old, created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and later cropping himself out. He posted the photos on his blog --\u00a0That Dad Blog -- and later on his Instagram\u00a0account. After receiving positive feedback, Lawrence decided to compile the photos in a calendar and plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down Syndrome foundations, KSL\u00a0reports. The family recently started a Kickstarter campaign 'When Wil was little, he would lie on his stomach and raise his arms and legs like he was flying. It wasn't something any of my other kids did,' Lawrence told ABC. 'We all said, 'Look, he's flying!' Lawrence said his goal is to raise awareness about Down Syndrome. He admitted in his blog that he and his wife Nikki knew very little about the disorder when Wil was born in October 2013. The father said he hopes to photograph Wil 'flying' in other destinations to raise more awareness. He also told ABC he hopes to help people overseas who do not have access to the same level of care through his YouTube channel by posting therapy tutorials.

On the table the five-time world champion enjoyed a successful day, firing two rapid centuries in establishing a 12-4 lead, needing just one more in Monday's closing session to the match to reach the quarter-finals.

Mr Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller Road making a lot of noise at around 9pm Thursday night. Phillip Pama covered his face as he left Brisbane Magistrate Courts where he was granted conditional bail on Friday Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr Yeaman was making a commotion. Pama\u2019s defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music and yelling at \u2018the world at large\u2019.

And at least 15 per cent \u2013 more than 544,000 \u2013 are completely fake. StatusPeople.com, the oldest publicly available Twitter-auditing tool, reports that 44 per cent of the former secretary of state's followers are 'good'; 15 per cent are 'fake'; and 41 per cent are 'inactive,' meaning that they never tweet or reply to any tweets. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO FAKERS: According to one popular online audit tool, only 44 per cent of Hillary Clinton's Twitter followers are real people who participate on the social media platform 'I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT': Clinton has cast herself as a champion of 'everyday Americans' Another Twitter sleuthing website sampled more than 320,000 of Clinton's followers and found that a much larger number of them were 'fake' Just 4 per cent of President Barack Obama's Twitter followers, by comparison, are considered fake. The White House worked overtime to purge most of them after a September 2013 report found that more than half\u00a0of his followers didn't really exist. Michelle Obama's Twitter audience is 25 per cent fake, according to StatusPeople, along with 21 per cent of Vice President Joe Biden's. Another tool, TwitterAudit.com, sampled 320,000 of Mrs. Clinton's followers and found that 18 per cent were fake. The new measurements will add to the Clinton presidential campaign's embarrassment following news on Tuesday that a large number of her Facebook fans may represent 'likes' that were purchased rather than earned. REALLY? Hillary Clinton's Twitter follower-count appears to be significantly inflated FACEBOOK FAKERY: Clinton boasts two-thirds of a million Facebook 'likes,' but more than 46,000 of them list 'Baghdad' as their hometown Vocativ reported that at least 7 per cent of them listed Baghdad, Iraq as their hometown, a larger number than any U.S. city. That would represent more than 46,000 people. Additional evidence of digital astroturfing is that while most of her U.S. Facebook fans are older than 55, most of the Baghdad contingent is in the 18-34 age range. While Clinton was America's top diplomat, her State Department was buying Facebook 'likes,'\u00a0according to an Associated Press report from last year. 'In 2013, the State Department, which has more than 400,000 likes and was recently most popular in Cairo, said it would stop buying Facebook fans after its inspector general criticized the agency for spending $630,000 to boost the numbers,' the wire service reported. Clinton left the agency while the inspector general was investigating. ASTROTURF?

The idea of having another referendum on Scotland's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters. It comes after Scottish First Minister  Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections. Scroll down for video Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was campaigning in Aberdeen today ahead of a second TV debate tonight When questioned on the issue in last night's Scottish leaders TV debate, Ms Sturgeon insisted an SNP victory in the General Election would not trigger another referendum. But she added it was 'another matter' whether a vote for her party in the 2016 Holyrood elections would bring about a second vote on independence. Ms Sturgeon has also vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. But a poll by Ipsos Mori for BBC Scotland reveals that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was more popular with voters north of the border than another independence ballot. More than 1,000 adults were questioned for the research, with pollsters asking them to give various issues a score of between one and 10, depending on how important these were to them. A score of one meant a policy should not be implemented while 10 was taken to mean it should be put into action immediately. In last night's TV showdown with the Scottish leaders of Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems, Mr Sturgeon refused to rule out a second independence vote before 2020 Ms Sturgeon has\u00a0 vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe The most popular policy was increasing the minimum wage for those aged over 21, which was given a score of 8.2. Giving the Scottish Parliament power over all welfare benefits was eighth most popular, with a score of 7.1, while transferring full responsibility for income tax to Holyrood came 10th on the list at 6.8. Holding another independence referendum by 2020 was given a score of 5.6, compared to 6.1 for a referendum on remaining in the EU. Scottish National Party election campaign director Angus Robertson insisted the poll showed support for his party's main policies. He said: 'This is a very welcome poll - it demonstrates that the people of Scotland share our view that the Westminster parties are not delivering on their referendum vow, and want far more power for Scotland. 'Electing a strong team of SNP MPs in May is the only way to ensure that Scotland gets the power we need to build social justice and economic prosperity.' Scotland's political leaders, from left to right, Tory Ruth Davidson, Labour's Jim Murphy, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie faced off in a live TV election debate last night Overall, Scots prefer more public spending ahead of paying off the deficit \u2013 but also favour the Government's welfare cap. However, there is also widespread support for a Mansion Tax and an increase in the top rate of income tax to 50p. Mark Diffley, Director, Ipsos MORI Scotland said: 'The poll gives a clear steer about where the economic priorities for voters in Scotland lie. 'Broadly, Scots want to see measures to improve the standard of living, particularly a higher minimum wage, rises in pensions and lower energy bills. 'There is also a preference for higher targeted public spending even if that means the deficit is not eliminated in the next five years and targeted tax increases for those with the greatest income and wealth.'", "candidate_sentences": ["Scottish voters would rather have a referendum on the EU than another independence vote, a new survey has revealed.", "Idea of having another referendum on Scotland's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters.", "It comes after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections."], "candidate_words": [["Scottish", "voters", "would", "rather", "have", "a", "referendum", "on", "the", "EU", "than", "another", "independence", "vote,", "a", "new", "survey", "has", "revealed."], ["Idea", "of", "having", "another", "referendum", "on", "Scotland's", "future", "in", "the", "UK", "before", "2020", "was", "ranked", "19th", "on", "a", "list", "of", "23", "policies", "presented", "to", "voters."], ["It", "comes", "after", "Scottish", "First", "Minister", "Nicola", "Sturgeon", "last", "night", "refused", "to", "rule", "out", "staging", "a", "second", "independence", "vote", "if", "the", "SNP", "wins", "the", "2016", "Holyrood", "elections."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Jamie Silvonek was charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin announced Thursday. Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was fatally stabbed in the driveway of her Upper Macungie Township home early March 15, hours after taking Jamie Silvonek and the eighth-grader's boyfriend, Army Spc. Caleb Barnes, to a concert, according to court documents. Scroll down for video Star-crossed lovers: Jamie Silvonek (left), 14, and her boyfriend, 20-year-old Army Spc Caleb Barnes (right), have been charged with killing the girl's mother for trying to break them up Barnes, who was on leave from Fort Meade in Maryland at the time of the slaying, was previously charged with homicide. He confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. Slain in cold blood: Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was stabbed several times in the neck inside her car after driving her daughter and Barnes from a concert The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, given the age disparity. 'There has to be some type of duress or coercion,' he said. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. 'She cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom, and told me she was coerced, she was afraid she was going to be killed, she was afraid her dad was going to be killed,' Waldron told The Associated Press. 'So there's a lot of things we have to decipher here.' Authorities said Barnes and Jamie Silvonek met in October \u2014 when she was 13 \u2014 but that she told him she was 17.\u00a0He joined the military in February of 2012. Barnes graduated advanced training from the Presidio of Monterey, California, and his awards include the Good Conduct Medal and National Defense Service Medal, Army Times reported. Cheryl Silvonek found out about their relationship in early March and ordered the couple to break up, according to court documents. A day later, the teenager told Barnes she wanted her parents dead, the documents said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. Police found the victim's blood-soaked car submerged in a pond and traced it to the Silvonek family's home in\u00a0Upper Macungie Township (pictured) Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' The teenager then texted Barnes: 'She threatened to throw me out of the house. I want her gone,' the affidavit said. Later, she allegedly wrote to him: 'Just do it.' Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. 'I can't stand her lying to you like this,' Jamie wrote to Barnes. 'SHE IS LYING ABOUT MY AGE,' reported Lehigh Valley Live. Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Lies: Barnes and Jamie Silvonek met in October \u2014 when she was 13 \u2014 but that she told him she was 17 Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home.

The 22-year-old, from Melbourne, was jogging along a street in the rural southern Oklahoma city of Duncan in August 2013, when he was shot in the back with a .22 calibre handgun. His parents, Donna and Peter Lane listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency phone call made by Oklahoma resident who witnessed their son collapsed on the side of the road. Chancey Luna, 17, was charged with  first-degree murder. The teen was riding in a Ford Focus with two teenage friends when he allegedly pulled the trigger as the vehicle drove past.

Joy Smith: No he's [gasping noise], that's all he's doing, making that noise. 9-11: All right, you just stay on the line with me, OK? Joy Smith: If you don't hurry, he's gone. 9-11: Ma'am, they're coming OK, I can't make them come any faster. Joy Smith: Oh my gosh how long's it going to be? He's stopped breathing. Mr Lane, who was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University, was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was randomly gunned down. Family and friends, including Mr Lane's former girlfriend Sarah Harper, heard details about how two bystanders tried to resuscitate the young man who had stopped breathing and wept during the proceedings at the Duncan's District Court on Wednesday. Members of the family broke into loud, uncontrolled sobs when authorities showed the white baseball cap Lane wore when he was shot and photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue. Linda Prior cried as she told court how she attempted to shut Lane's 'big brown eyes' but wasn't able to after failing to resuscitate him. 'The big brown eyes were just staring at me,' Ms Prior, who has first aid training and performed CPR, told the court.

Another local, Richard Rhoades, who also tried to help Lane, said he took off his shirt to place it over Lane's face when they realised he was dead. 'I just thought it would be nice to close his eyes,' he said. Luna's lawyer, Jim Berry, made a shock admission in court on Tuesday that his client had fired the bullet that killed Lane but added the teen was 'reckless' and was only trying to 'scare the jogger'. The lawyer told the jury that for Luna to be found guilty of first degree murder, the prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt the murder was premeditated. Prosecutors said Luna internationally pulled the trigger. The trial continues.

They are so big, in fact, that students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual, according to a new survey. With budgets for outfits, flowers, transportation, food and other sundries at around $1,000 for the average American high schooler, that means most intend to spend $324 on the once-simple query: Will you go to prom with me? Pricey promposals: Students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual of promposals, according to a survey of 3,000 people conducted by Visa That's according to a survey from Visa, which asked 3,000 people aged 18 or older what they expected to shell out for the prom and on what. For a primer on promposals, see previous years' winners of most outrageous (and viral) prom proposals. In 2012, Matthew Ho from Toronto promposed to his girlfriend, Tina, with 1,500 pink helium balloons and a sign that read, 'Tina, will you go to prom with me?' His stunt attracted a crowd in the hallway, giving the blindfolded Tina an audience when the stunt was finally revealed. It's unclear what the cost of these hockey pucks was, but the average American high schooler could spend over $300 just asking his or her date to the yearly dance In 2012, Matthew Ho from Toronto promposed to his girlfriend, Tina, with 1,500 pink helium balloons and a sign that read, 'Tina, will you go to prom with me?' His stunt attracted a crowd in the hallway, giving the blindfolded Tina an audience when the stunt was finally revealed Some students have even rented plane banners to pop the prom question - at a starting cost of $1,000 in the New York area. 'It started last year \u2014 I've been in the business six years, and we had never sold a prom banner before then,' explained Remy Colin of Aerial Messages in Daytona Beach, Florida. At John B. Alexander High School in Laredo, Texas, senior student Isaac Garza asked his best friend, Kristelle, to prom in dramatic pre-planned chase scene with the school . Dressed in a tuxedo, and running into a packed assembly hall where Kristelle was waiting, unaware of what was going on, Mr Garza performed a rendition of Heath Ledger's famous scene in Ten Things I Hate About You, singing Lauren Hill's Can't Take My Eyes Off of You. Arresting: Palmdale, California student Davyeon was 'arrested' in his lunchroom thanks to prom date Stephanie. No word on how much she bribed the officer who cuffed him Not always pricey:\u00a0Mike Ramirez, student at Crosby High School in suburban Houston, managed to get Texans cheerleader\u00a0Caitlyn to go to the prom with him by getting 10,000 retweets Jamie Vandenberg from Ontario, Canada, promposed to his girlfriend Madison Dillion using a fake pop quiz that his teacher distributed at the beginning of class. As students reached question three, where Mr Vanenberg laid out statistical quandaries to Miss Dillon's yes or no answer, they realized their probability questionnaire was a ruse. When student Taylor Huestis opened her locker, 456 ping pong balls, all with 'prom' written on them, fell onto the floor. Huestis' boyfriend had planned the stunt for days, enlisting the help of her friends; his sign read 'I finally had the balls to ask you to prom!' Visa's prom survey also revealed some interesting regional and economic disparities. This year, Canadians plan to spend $508 overall on prom of which $151 will be on promposal, compared to $919 overall for U.S. families. Dads plan to outspend moms by 63%, $1160vs. $710.

Both skipper Kellock and Hall - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of May and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers. And while Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was naming his full squad for the Blues match on Thursday, he announced that the second-row and hooker would start in the pack against the Welsh outfit. Glasgow Warriors veteran Al Kellock will start at lock against Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night The encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and, in a nice touch by the club, the match ball will be presented by Kellock's dad and Hall's mum along with Alistair Johnson, who was Kellock's best man, and Bernie Mitchell, who was an inspirational figure for Hall coming through at Hillhead/Jordanhill. Having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 Scotland caps, Hall admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign. 'You get to a point where you start thinking to yourself 'this could be the last game of rugby I ever play' so you want to make the most of it,' the 34-year-old said. 'I really want to enjoy these last few games, but also stay focused and help the Warriors secure a play-off place and hopefully the trophy. Glasgow hooker Dougie Hall is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby As retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game. You start to think about your last team huddle, the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that I will miss incredibly.' Since he first played in the equivalent of the PRO12 for Edinburgh Rugby back in 2002/03 Hall has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly. As a result, despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table, he does not expect an easy night, far from it. 'They have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year,' he explained. 'We really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play-offs in the coming weeks. 'I hope that gone are the days when the PRO12 is looked on as a lesser league, the teams and the talent involved now really is top class.' Gregor Townsend's Glasgow side are currently top of the Pro12 standings ahead of Cardiff's visit This season Hall has been restricted to seven appearances in the PRO12 for the Warriors to date, Fraser Brown and Pat MacArthur playing the majority of minutes with Kevin Bryce also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey. And while Hall himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio, he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run-in and in the play-offs. 'The last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym,' Hall explained. 'For me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field I can give it everything. 'As you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group, but I like to think I have acted like that since I came to the Warriors in 2007. Wales prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for Cardiff as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain 'I was the starting hooker for a number of years and as Pat, and more recently, Fraser and Kevin have come in I hope they have learnt from watching what I do and also have learnt from what I say too.' Meanwhile, Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match with a calf strain. The injury forced the Wales and British & Irish Lions' man off last week in his side's European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat to the Dragons. 'Gethin has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought. He hasn't trained this week so is a doubt, but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season,' Blues attack coach Paul John said. 'We want to play to a game plan, execute well and perform to the best of our ability. To do justice to the league we have to do that.

'I don't think there was anything unusual about either parent and this is the first time we have bred a lamb as large as this,' she said. 'His mother must have been relieved when it was over.' She added that the farm hopes to keep Ben as a breeding ram in the hope he will pass his amazing features to his future flock.

He was named The Big One and is believed to be the heaviest lamb ever born in the wild. Last year Goliath was born at a hefty 22lbs 5oz in Wellington in Somerset. The title for the heaviest Suffolk cross lamb was Bruno, nicknamed 'Woooly Lamboth', who was born in Worcestershire in 2009 at a healthy 21lbs. Bruno was spared the chop because of his size as his owner decided to keep him as a pet because he was curious to know just how big he would get. New Zealand is the world's biggest producer of lambs.

'Also, I was a little bit unhappy and I think you could see that I was unhappy. \u2018I asked the coach for a reason and he told me that I was tired. Maybe I was a little bit tired.

The dramatic event could explain why our planet has a hot core that gives it its magnetic field. And it could also explain why certain rare-earth elements in Earth\u2019s mantle do not seem to originate from the planet\u2019s other building blocks - meteorites. Oxford scientists say a Mercury-like body struck the young Earth (artist's illustration shown). The object would have been the heat source for our planet's core. The same object could have been responsible for creating the moon. It also explains where some rare-Earth elements came from The study, by two scientists from the University of Oxford, was published in the journal Nature. Our current theory of Earth\u2019s formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. However, this model cannot explain where the heat source for Earth\u2019s core - and ultimately its magnetic field - came from. In addition, Earth\u2019s crust and mantle appear to have a higher ratio of the rare-earth elements samarium and neodymium than most meteorites - suggesting there was more at play in Earth\u2019s formation than first thought. To address this discrepancy, scientists believe that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars - but like Mercury in its composition - early in its life. This likely would have happened about 4.5 billion years ago. The body would have been rich in sulphur but very poor in oxygen - just like Mercury. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. But one mystery has persisted, revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition? Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon. Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon. Or Theia could have, coincidentally, been isotopically similar to young Earth. A third possibility is that the moon formed from Earthen materials, rather than from Theia, although this would have been a very unusual type of impact. Our current theory of Earth\u2019s (left) formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. Now scientists think that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars, but like Mercury (right) in its composition, early in its life. In the young solar system 4.5 billion years ago, illustrated, various planetesimals and other small bodies coalesced together to form larger bodies like Earth As it collided with Earth, it would have produced radioactive uranium and thorium, generating the heat needed to drive the \u2018dynamo\u2019 of molten iron in Earth\u2019s core. And they do not rule out the possibility that this is the same Mars-sized body that formed the moon. \u2018We think that that is quite conceivable,\u2019 said study co-author Bernard Wood, reported the LA Times. \u2018It's kind of exciting to think that this reduced body could actually be the thing which caused the moon.\u2019 In an accompanying News and Views article for Nature, Dr Richard Carlson of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC said the theory could open up new avenues for thought..

The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post\u00a0on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.' He added: 'This is a challenge where I get to take what makes Silicon Valley special and apply it to a product that directly impacts people's lives everyday as they move around the world's cities.'

And while it was a good day Woods, the golfing great still had some stressful moments and still has a way to go in catching up to leader, 21-year-old Jordan Spieth. Heading into the weekend he is a very, very distant 12 strokes behind a seemingly unstoppable Spieth, with 36 holes left to play. Scroll down for video Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta Friday to watch boyfriend Tiger Woods (above) play in the second round of the Masters Vonn (above) looked stressed at times though Woods played a solid round, carding a three-under-par 69 Woods is still well behind the leader, hot young American star Jordan Spieth (above) This as\u00a0Woods, competing after a two-month absence to retool his game, showed flashes of his old magic as he fired his best score at the Masters in four years in Friday's second round. The former world number one has been under intense scrutiny after struggling badly with his chipping when last seen on the PGA Tour but he played solidly at steamy Augusta National to card a three-under-par 69. That left Woods at two-under 142, far behind the pacesetting American Spieth, but still delighted to be in contention after working hard to resurrect his game. If Spieth wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in Masters history with Woods This was Vonn's second day in a row cheering on Woods 'I'm still right there,' 14-time major winner Woods said of his position going into the weekend 'I was at a pretty low one (point) in my career,' Woods said after mixing four birdies with a bogey to climb into a tie for 14th when he ended his round. 'To basically change an entire (swing) pattern like that and put it together, put it in a position where I can compete in a major championship like this is something I'm very proud of.' Woods, who plunged to 111th in the rankings as he struggled to return to form following back surgery last year and his fifth swing change, again struggled with the pace of Augusta National's heavily contoured greens. 'I had a hard time getting the ball close to the hole,' said Woods. 'You expect certain putts to roll out, but they're not rolling out.' Watched by huge galleries, Woods made a fast start, hitting a superb approach to seven feet at the par-four first and rolling in the birdie putt as shouts of 'Watch out, Tiger's back' and 'Come on Tiger, let's go' rang out. Spieth, 21, broke the 36 hole record on Friday and is 14-under-par for the tournament, 12 strokes ahead of Woods His only bogey came at the par-three sixth, his tee shot ending up just off the back of the green from where he had 45 feet to the flag but hit a weak chip that advanced just 20 feet. Woods immediately rebounded in birdie-birdie style, draining a 25-footer at the tricky seventh and hitting his third shot at the par-five eighth to two feet. He birdied the 11th after conjuring a moment of magic from the pine straw to the right of the fairway, a soaring approach settling 12 feet from the cup. 'I'm still right there,' the 14-time major winner said of his position going into the weekend. 'I'm 12 back, but there's not a lot of guys ahead of me.

The driver, known as Salim, is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in Jaipur on Friday evening. The man, from Todabhim in Karauli district of Rajasthan, is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody. A spokesman for Rajasthan Police said they had taken statements from the woman and her friend, India Times reported. 'We have arrested taxi driver Salim on a complaint filed by a British tourist on early Saturday.' said the man. 'He was arrested under Section 354 of IPC (Indian Penal Code). He was sent to judicial custody,' His arrest follows a number of incidents reported to have taken place in India against tourists and locals, which have led to widespread protests. On February 8 a Japanese tourist filed a complaint accusing a tout of raping her in Dudu, around 60km away from Jaipur. The woman had been on a tour when the man allegedly approached her and offered his service as a guide. In March a 75-year-old Indian nun was gang raped by a group of eight robbers when she confronted them after they broke in to the\u00a0Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal state's Nadia district. There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times.

As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than \u00a31,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work\u2013 even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous \u2013 spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her. She said: 'I started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs: in a coffee shop, a pub and as a waitress. None paid enough. 'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.' She added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially. 'I had trouble keeping up with course work, especially if I worked evenings. 'For example at the pub, I'd earn \u00a37 an hour for an eight hour shift, two nights a week, so I'd bring home about \u00a3100 weekly. 'I'd just moved to London from the north of England. My family are not well off, so cannot afford to help me much. The student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in London 'I didn't know anyone in London so when I moved here it was starting from scratch.' Initially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better. 'It was an overcrowded, noisy flat with other students,' she said of her halls. She moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services. 'I could afford a place of my own. I advertise through a website and have regular clients. 'I visit them at home, in hotels and occasionally at their workplace.' Despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies. 'It is flexible and fits around my course. 'I can work the hours I want to and scale back around exam time or if I have extra course work.' The woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money. 'In my first year at university I started hearing about students turning to sex work,' she said. 'After a time I met someone on another course who'd been working as a stripper in a bar. 'Through her I met another student doing escorting, she clued me in, said where to advertise, and how to avoid bad clients and work safely. 'She gave me the English Collective of Prostitutes' Rights sheet which tells about the laws and how they work. Although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in London the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work.

The family's popular reality show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, was cancelled by TLC after photos emerged of Shannon spending time with convicted child molester Mark McDaniel. June's oldest daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, has accused McDaniel of repeatedly abusing her when she was just a child. In the wake of the cancellation, Thompson's younger brother - Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson \u2013 revealed to The National Enquirer  that Shannon had indulged in a 'threesome' with Sugar Bear and older brother Billy back in 2007.

Football League board member Jim Rodwell\u2019s departure from Notts County to become chief executive of Scunthorpe has created the need for an election for a League One representative as Rodwell cannot automatically keep his place. League One clubs have been informed that there are two nominations for the vacant seat \u2014 Rodwell and former Manchester United director Maurice Watkins, now chairman of Barnsley. Tony Fernandes, owner of QPR, wants to avoid fines of up to \u00a350million for Financial Fair Play breaches Maurice Watkins is a sports lawyer whose firm represents QPR over their considerable FFP troubles QPR are 19th in the Premier League, four points away from escaping the relegation zone Watkins is a sports lawyer and his firm Brabners are representing QPR over their considerable FFP troubles. Clubs believe that having Watkins on the Football League board, where FFP is the hot topic, would be helpful for QPR and a massive conflict of interests. However, the highly-respected Watkins, who has a number of sporting directorships including British Swimming and Lancashire County Cricket Club, dismissed the conspiracy theory as \u2018wholly ludicrous\u2019.

The breakdown in the relationship between the FA and England Supporters Travel Club led to the offensive chants during England\u2019s 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday.

Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs \u2014 and the World War Two favourites \u2014 will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues.

But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night \u2013 before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.'

The humanoid, known as Ham, has been drawing in crowds with his incredible range of facial expressions at an electronics event in Hong Kong this week. The head, designed by American robotics designer David Hanson, is able to answer basic questions and can also be used in the simulation of medical scenarios. Scroll down for video Incredibly lifelike: Known as Ham, this humanoid is made using\u00a0specialised software and can recognise and respond to facial expressions Ham is currently on exhibit at the Global Sources spring electronics show at AsiaWorld Expo - the largest event of its kind in the world, with more than 4,000 booths displaying the latest gadgets. The head is created with malleable material called Frubber\u00a0using soft-bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology. It contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across (there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre). Using specialised software the machine can recognise and respond to a number of human facial expressions in a natural way. According to Hanson Robotics's website, the humanoids can actually see your face, make eye contact with you, and understand speech to 'engage you in witty dialogue'. Such reactions are a major feat of engineering, according to chief designer David Hanson, the founder and and president of Hanson Robotics. Reactive: The robot smiles using multiple motors - which whir into action and subtly adjust multiple points of articulation around his mouth and brown eyes State-of-the-art:\u00a0The head is created with malleable material using soft-bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology. It contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across (there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre) It is not the first human-looking robot that his firm has created either. An earlier version of Ham drew headlines as it was sculpted to look like Albert Einstein, complete with a bushy moustache and a shock of white hair. The Einstein humanoid made facial expressions by using multiple motors - which whir\u00a0into action and subtly adjust multiple points of articulation around his mouth and brown eyes. Mr Hanson sees robotics as his calling and works on many fronts, from sculpting features to developing artificial intelligence. To advance to the next step of producing robots for everyday applications in entertainment, health care and education, he decided to move to Hong Kong with his family - his wife Amanda and their son Zeno. The city has a booming robotics community with a high amount of expertise and design infrastructure and new technology can be developed at a lower cost than in the US.

The Prime Minister said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor'. He accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Scroll down for video The Prime Minister, delivering a major speech on the economy in Bedford today, said Labour had left millions of people trapped on welfare in a system which 'punished the poor' Mr Cameron, in a major speech on the economy this morning, said the Tories were overhauling the benefit system, increasing the minimum wage and providing more free child care to help parents get to work. He added: \u2018True compassion isn\u2019t giving people a benefits cheque \u2013 it\u2019s giving them a chance.\u2019 He said Labour had left a system where a single mum, working 15 hours and earning \u00a387 a week, would have actually lost money if she had taken on any more work. Mr Cameron said families stuck on benefits were not \u2018playing the system\u2019 but were \u2018victims of it\u2019. He said they were \u2018victims of a welfare trap laid by Labour, paid for by hardworking taxpayers\u2019. The PM added: That destroyed aspiration. It created resentment. And it was never meant to be this way. Welfare was meant to be a safety net \u2013 not a web from which no-one could escape. \u2018So when I hear Labour politicians bleating on about the same old Tories, not on the side of working people, I just think: some brass neck. \u2018It was you who trapped the poor on welfare and widened inequality. Yes, you Ed Miliband and Ed Balls who designed these systems that punished the lowest paid. So don\u2019t you dare lecture us on poverty. \u2018And know this \u2013 the true party of working people in Britain today is us, the Conservative Party.\u2019 Mr Cameron accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of having 'some brass neck' by attacking the Tories for failing the poor, adding: 'Don't you dare lecture us on poverty.' Mr Cameron promised extra free childcare for 600,000 children a year to counter spiralling costs and said the expense of nurseries and childminders has become a major barrier to employment. The Conservatives have pledged to reduce tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than \u00a3150,000 to fund additional free childcare places. \u2018For many second earners, work didn\u2019t pay because the cost of childcare was so high. So we introduced 15 hours of free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds and disadvantaged two-year-olds. \u2018In the next Parliament we will double that for three- and four-year-olds. That\u2019 s right \u2013 30 hours of free childcare a week \u2013 worth \u00a35,000 to working families. \u2018That means over 600,000 extra free childcare places available for families every year \u2013 nine million extra hours of childcare a week and parents able to work an extra 78 days a year without any childcare costs \u2013 all by 2017.\u2019 Mr Cameron also argued \u2018that true compassion isn\u2019t giving people a benefits cheque \u2013 it\u2019s giving them a chance\u2019.

Sinfield was on the losing side on his debut for the Rhinos against Sheffield Eagles at Headingley in 1997 and he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion, with the Wolves running out 29-10 winners. The Rhinos were already trailing 20-4 when the former England skipper entered the action five minutes into the second half and it did not get much better as the Yorkshiremen came up with their worst performance of the season in front of a 17,430 crowd. Warrington Wolves forward\u00a0Roy Asotasi crosses for one of his side's five tries on the night Warrington had produced their best display in an 18-6 win over Leeds in March and they were again outstanding, with full-back Stefan Ratchford and second rower Ben Currie the pick of an impressive bunch. Leeds had an early chance when prop Adam Cuthbertson was held up over the line but then it was virtually all Warrington as they established a stranglehold on the game. Loose forward Ben Harrison was held up on his back before his back-row partner Currie produced a measured grubber kick on the last tackle to create a try for winger Gene Ormsby. Leeds Rhinos winger Kallum Watkins does brilliantly to touch down in the corner It was then Harrison's turn to demonstrate his kicking skills to get his captain Joel Monaghan in for a second try, although there was a strong hint of a forward pass in the build-up. With scrum-half Richie Myler causing all sorts of problems for the Rhinos defence with his penetrative running, the visitors were good value for their 8-0 lead and it got even better for them on 23 minutes when prop Ashton Sims took hooker Mick Higham's pass near the line to go through a gaping hole for a third try. Ratchford was off target with his first two attempts at goal but it was third time lucky as he made it 14-0 and a Higham 40-20 kick enabled Warrington to maintain the momentum. Warrington forward Ben Harrison is tackled by Stevie Ward during a frantic contest at Headingley Sinfield stayed on the bench throughout the first half but the introduction of forward Mitch Achurch helped perk up the Rhinos in the last 10 minutes and they pulled a try back in scintillating fashion when winger Kallum Watkins finished off a flowing move at the corner. The Leeds captain entered the action five minutes into the second half but his side were trailing 20-4 by then after a break by lively substitute Daryl Clark created the position for Ratchford to get Currie over for Warrington's fourth try. And there was no way back for Sinfield's men when Ormsby's neat offload enabled substitute prop Roy Asotasi to score his first try for more than 12 months. Leeds Rhinos veteran Kevin Sinfield made his 500th appearance for the club on Friday night Ratchford kicked his third goal to stretch his side's lead to 26-4 and increased it with a penalty on 63 minutes after Jamie Peacock was pulled up for a high tackle. The home side pulled a try back five minutes later through Achurch and Sinfield kicked the goal but it was little more than consolation and the Wolves had the final say when stand-off Declan Patton slotted a drop goal to open his account for the club on his third appearance.", "candidate_sentences": ["Warrington Wolves beat Leeds Rhinos 29-10 at Headingley on Friday night.", "Kevin Sinfield made his 500th appearance for the Rhinos.", "The Rhinos were already trailing 20-4 when the former England skipper entered the action five minutes into the second half.", "Warrington had produced their best display in an 18-6 win over Leeds in March."], "candidate_words": [["Warrington", "Wolves", "beat", "Leeds", "Rhinos", "29-10", "at", "Headingley", "on", "Friday", "night."], ["Kevin", "Sinfield", "made", "his", "500th", "appearance", "for", "the", "Rhinos."], ["The", "Rhinos", "were", "already", "trailing", "20-4", "when", "the", "former", "England", "skipper", "entered", "the", "action", "five", "minutes", "into", "the", "second", "half."], ["Warrington", "had", "produced", "their", "best", "display", "in", "an", "18-6", "win", "over", "Leeds", "in", "March."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

Hamilton was relaxed. Vettel was downcast, but said that the race may be a different story from qualifying. Hamilton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough.

Gertrud Tiefenbacher's hands had been tied with a typewriter cord and a towel placed over a face, say local police. Her body was found by other nuns at the Sacred Heart Missionary in Ixopo, a small town 85 miles south-west of Durban. Police in KwaZulu-Natal are waiting for the results of forensic tests to confirm that Sister Gertrud was sexually assaulted. They say she was suffocated but they are unsure how many men attacked her. A small sum of money - thought to be in euros - had been stolen from her room. The victim's friend Betty Firmstone, 85, told South Africa's\u00a0Daily News: 'I met Sister in 1952 when I started teaching at a school attached to the mission.\u00a0We worked very closely together. She loved her work with children. 'This really was an act of savagery against a gentle, caring soul.' Sister Gertrud had lived at the missionary for 60 years after moving to South Africa from her native Austria.

'It is alleged that the victim was at her residence when she was approached by a suspect who allegedly tied her hands with a typewriter cord,' he added. 'She was also covered with a towel over her face, causing the victim to suffocate. Rape is also suspected in this matter. 'We are following all leads. We are also appealing to the community to come forward with any information.'

It is also a home for young women who are considering becoming nuns. Sister Gerald, who lives at the mission, said Sister Gertrud had dedicated her life to helping impoverished children and adolescents.

{"id": "bc57e520b34b77aa4c199d10bf64b58767b588ea", "article": "Barry Beavis, 48, lost his case at the Court of Appeal Millions of motorists face spiralling parking fines after judges ruled yesterday that \u00a385 was not an 'excessively high' penalty for staying too long in a car park. Barry Beavis launched a legal bid to overturn his fine, saying it was unfair, disproportionate and unenforceable. But in a landmark ruling, appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither 'extravagant or unconscionable'. Motoring groups reacted in fury to the decision, accusing the judges \u2013 who are thought to earn more than \u00a3200,000 a year \u2013 of being 'out of touch'. Mr Beavis, from Chelmsford, Essex, had gone to court to fight what he called the 'bullying and threatening' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces. The 48-year-old, who runs a fish and chip shop, got the \u00a385 fine in April 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the Riverside Retail park in Chelmsford. The car park, run by parking firm ParkingEye Ltd, allowed two hours of free parking, but Mr Beavis stayed for three. He claimed the \u00a385 charge against him was disproportionate and vowed to fight the companies who 'extort money by threatening and bullying people into paying up'. But yesterday judges said the fine was enforceable because it was not 'excessively high'. Mr Beavis said he was 'absolutely furious' and planned to appeal. Meanwhile motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys and would open the floodgates for unscrupulous profit-hungry firms 'falling over themselves' to ramp up the already hefty penalties they impose. Ian Taylor, of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'I think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think \u00a385 isn't extravagant. 'An \u00a385 penalty may not seem much to a rich lawyer \u2013 it's probably less than many charge for an hour. But for the average hard-pressed motorist trying to make ends meet, it's a very heavy and unfair burden.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said the ruling would hand parking firms a 'blank cheque' to milk drivers, adding: 'This decision could cost motorists millions. 'If judges believe \u00a385 is not an extravagant amount then what is? \u00a3100? \u00a3200? Our fear is that parking firms will now be falling over themselves to raise their penalty charges and punish drivers.' Mr Beavis had parked his car at the Riverside Retail Park in Chelmsford, pictured above, on April 15, 2013, The retail site, pictured above, offers two free hours of parking and Mr Beavis was fined after he returned 56 minutes late Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said: 'We are concerned that this decision waters down the law on penalty charges and may encourage excessive default charges.' And AA president Edmund King said: 'Britain's motorists really will think judges are out of touch with everyday life if they consider \u00a385 to be a reasonable amount of money for a parking penalty. \u00a385 may not seem much to highly paid lawyers but it represents a great deal of money to cash-strapped motorists.' He added: 'This is a licence to print money for people who have now been handed an open cheque-book and invited to make up the figures as they like.' Speaking outside of the Court of Appeal Mr Beavis said he would now be taking the case to the Supreme Court Parking trap: Many motorists face steep fines for running a few minutes over their allotted time The three judges who unanimously dismissed the challenge \u2013 Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lord Justice Patten and Sir Timothy Lloyd \u2013 are all thought to earn around \u00a3202,000 a year. Yesterday ParkingEye welcomed the judgment, saying it gave 'clarity to motorists and the parking industry' and 'further confirms that our parking charges are fair, reasonable and legally enforceable'. But speaking outside court, Mr Beavis said: 'These firms are not run on a moral basis, they're only out to make as much money as they can, to profiteer from unsuspecting motorists. I am utterly furious and will continue the fight.' Mr Beavis's action comes after the Daily Mail revealed how rogue firms are making millions of pounds from fines handed to motorists who overstay \u2013 sometimes for only a few minutes \u2013 in car parks at hospitals, railway stations and shopping centres. Cancer sufferers and patients whose treatments have over-run are among those who have been ripped off by the parking firms.

The star, known for appearing in All Creatures Great and Small and playing Winston Churchill several times, is auctioning off more than 200 items he has collected over his career. Mr Hardy, 89, is a keen military historian who studied English with J.R.R. Tolkien and is now an expert on the medieval longbow. Sale: Actor Robert Hardy is selling off his collection of antiques including a diorama of the Battle of Agincourt Cabinets: A pair of early Victorian items of furniture made by Gillows of Lancaster which are set to fetch up to \u00a34,000 at the auction on Saturday Portrait: A painting of Mr Hardy holding a longbow, reflecting his interest in medieval history One of the most unusual items featured in the auction of his possessions is a hand-painted limewood diorama depicted the progress of the Battle of Agincourt in 3D. The piece was created by artist L.M. Rendall in the 1960s after being commissioned by Mr Hardy himself, and has an estimate of \u00a34,000 to \u00a36,000. There is also a longbow made from yew with a mother-of-pearl handle, as well as a portrait of Mr Hardy holding the bow, which is set to sell for up to \u00a32,000.

A total of 238 lots are being sold by Dominic Winter auctioneers at its saleroom in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. Mr Hardy, who lives in the Cotswolds, said that he was sad to sell his collection. 'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said. 'Entrusting it all to Dominic Winter and Co has taken away much of the pain, and through them I wish anyone who comes to possess anything that was mine as much joy and pleasure as it has given me through the years.'

He was also consulted as an expert during the raising of the Tudor shipwreck the Mary Rose. Mr Hardy, a close friend of Richard Burton, worked with top actors including Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud and Judi Dench during his early days as a Shakespearean specialist.

Abase Hussen \u2013 who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join IS earlier this year \u2013 conceded the teenager was \u2018maybe\u2019 influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun. Mr Hussen told MPs last month, after his daughter Amira Abase fled to Syria aged 15, that he could think of \u2018nothing\u2019 to explain why she and two friends had decided to join IS, as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism. Scroll down for video Abase Hussen, left, took his daughter Amira, right, to a demonstration when she was aged just 13 Abase Hussen, circled, \u00a0marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London in 2012 It then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob, screaming in rage at a protest outside the US embassy in London, in 2012. Also at the rally were hate cleric Anjem Choudary and Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He has now apologised for attending, but admitted going to two further rallies \u2013 with his impressionable daughter in tow. One took place outside the Saudi embassy in London, in 2013, and is said to have been organised by the Islamic extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, founded by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and linked to many Islamic terror atrocities of the past decade. Yesterday Mr Hussen, who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife Fetia, conceded they might have influenced the youngster, who would have been 13 at the time. \u2018The only reason we took her first time, was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go,\u2019 he said. The rally was held against the treatment of Ethiopians in Saudi Arabia after human rights violations, and Mr Hussen, 47, who is from Ethiopia, said: \u2018We both lost many people back home, we wanted to try to get help for people back home, too many human rights violations there. Many died. Maybe it influenced her.\u2019 Amira was one of three girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London who flew to Turkey before being smuggled across the border into Syria in February. Soon after, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to Syria. Asked by chairman Keith Vaz if Amira had been exposed to any extremism, Mr Hussen replied: \u2018Not at all. Nothing.\u2019 Yesterday respected analyst Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King\u2019s College London, tweeted: \u2018Remember that Amira Abase\u2019s father blamed the police for his daughter going to Syria and effectively misled Parliament with this nonsense.\u2019 Mr Hussen told The Times yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag-burning rally. He said: \u2018I went to show my feelings because my religion was being insulted, my faith. Protesting is not radical, it is our right.\u2019 Amira Abase, pictured, was one of three girls who flew from Gatwick to Turkey before crossing to Syria Asked why he was pictured at the front of the mob, he said: \u2018The crowd pushed me. I feel tricked. I did not know who they [the organisers] were. I just followed the crowd, I feel ashamed.\u2019 Mr Hussen came to Britain from Germany in 1999 and said he came \u2018for democracy, for the freedom, for a better life for children, so they could learn English\u2019. He said he was upset with his daughter joining IS, saying she was \u2018just a normal kid who is a victim of extremists\u2019. Mr Hussen said he felt \u2018terrible\u2019 to know he had been protesting with one of Mr Rigby\u2019s killers and said: \u2018It was brutal, it has nothing to do with Islam, it is not human. You don\u2019t do things like this.\u2019 Amira fled to become a \u2018jihadi bride\u2019 with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16. A fourth girl from their school, Sharmeena Begum, left for Syria in December. Giving evidence to the MPs\u2019 committee, Mr Hussen accused police of not doing enough to warn him and other parents. Last night Tory MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the committee, said: \u2018I would certainly be in favour of Mr Hussen being recalled to give him a full opportunity to explain what he clearly did not when he appeared before us. \u2018It\u2019s shocking and outrageous anyone would think it appropriate to take their 13-year-old to such a rally.

More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the \"most severe public health emergency seen in modern times\" showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand.

ISIS prides itself on its well-oiled propaganda offensive, pumping out images, videos and even a weekly English-language magazine designed to recruit and radicalise would-be jihadists. Co-ordinated by its AlHayat Media Centre, the terror group makes extensive use of social media to keep in near-constant contact with supporters in the West - even selling branded merchandise such as T-shirts, baseball caps and cuddly toys.

Violators will be jailed for ten days, during which time they will be made to take an 'Islamic course'.

Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme. Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years. He said: 'If you look back at the Third Programme (the original name for Radio 3), they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything. 'They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them. 'The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago \u2013 not consistently so, anyway. 'We have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works. 'It's not lowering the standard, it's not making the content simple. It's about how we present it.' Mr Davey, who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England, added: 'I believe there are different ways to draw people into music. 'There's the Classic FM way, and they're very good at that. 'We'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers, and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout.'

Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down and said there were distinct differences between the stations.

The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion'. But that her party want 'chaos and constitutional crisis' at Westminster to force another independence referendum. Scroll down for video Gordon Brown, pictured campaigning this week, has warned that the SNP want to use the chaos after the election to force another referendum on Scottish independence and urged 'patriotic Scots' to vote Labour And he warned that those casting their vote on May 7 will be deciding the future of Scotland for the next few years. Mr Brown was speaking during a joint event with local Labour candidate and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander at Elderslie Village Hall in Renfrewshire. He said: 'There is an SNP candidate in this constituency. She says vote SNP, get SNP MPs at Westminster and we will twist their arms and get another referendum. 'Remember what the SNP used to say - the referendum was once in a generation, then it changed a little to once in a lifetime, then it was once every 15 years and now when you ask Ms Sturgeon about this her answers are all evasion. She cannot give a straight answer to the question. 'But does not the SNP candidate in this constituency tell the truth, that what they want is an SNP vote not to deliver social justice but to deliver the chaos and constitutional crisis at Westminster to as she said force a second referendum. 'And I say I don't want the divisiveness, I don't want the bitterness, I don't want the acrimony, I don't want the divisions between families and communities in the next few months that we had in the past few months.' The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion' Mr Brown urged people to vote Labour to end the bedroom tax, food bank poverty, zero-hours contracts and the neglect of the NHS. He added: 'When you vote on May 7 remember that you are not just voting to end Tory austerity and the possibility of five more years of the bedroom tax and everything else, you're also voting on whether you are going to allow the SNP to use your vote to try to force a second referendum on this country within a few months or after the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.' He also said that Labour will hold an economic summit immediately after the General Election to boost jobs, expand city deals, encourage investment and provide jobs and training for young people. Mr Brown also urged people to be 'proud patriotic Scots' and back Labour's plan for full employment in Scotland. He said: 'Patriotism means, yes, supporting a strong Scottish parliament, but it doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation across the whole country that can deliver us full employment and more jobs. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the money that comes from the bankers' bonus tax that will allow Scottish young people to have jobs in the future. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation on research and innovation that will replace the Linwoods of the past and the lost jobs of the present with the new high-quality jobs of the future. 'And, yes, patriotism means a strong Scottish parliament but it doesn't need or require us to reject the partnership that allows us to fund the pensions of this country, sharing the resources of 60 million people across the whole country, far better than pooling the resources of only five million people, to secure the best pensions imaginable.' SNP Leader Nicola Sturgeon joins  female activists in Glasgow's Buchanan Street to launch the party's womens pledge today Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: 'While Gordon Brown appears to be re-fighting last year's referendum, the SNP are out talking to voters about next month's General Election and the huge opportunity to make Scotland stronger at Westminster. The contrast could not be clearer. 'Unfortunately for Labour Brown's speech this morning simply reminds people once again of how Labour stood shoulder to shoulder with the Tories for two and a half years to talk Scotland down. 'The question Labour's current leadership have repeatedly failed to answer is if there are more anti-Tory MPs - between the SNP and Labour - than there are Tory MPs, will they work with us to lock the Tories out and to deliver better policies for people not just in Scotland but across the rest of the UK. 'A strong team of SNP MPs can give Labour the backbone to oppose further cuts and pursue a progressive alternative to austerity.'

Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time. Greece has denied it will miss a repayment of \u00a3330million to the International Monetary Fund after reports it had drawn up plans to introduce a parallel drachma currency to pay its bills He said: 'We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time. We are ready to pay on April 9.' Sources close to the ruling Syriza party claimed the government was prioritising paying wages and pensions over any loans due, according to the Telegraph. It  reported that the nation no longer has the funds to repay the debt unless the eurozone agrees to pay the next portion of its interim bail-out deal in time. A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer. 'We may have to go into a silent arrears process with the IMF. This will cause a furore in the markets and means that the clock will start to tick much faster.' German magazine Der Spiegel quoted a finance ministry general secretary, Nikos Theocharakis, as saying Greece would probably not pay next week's IMF tranche, prompting a further denial from the Greek finance ministry. Theocharakis said Greece would be 'close to the end' on April 9 and called the technical teams from its creditors 'completely useless,' according to an extract of the article due to be published on Saturday. 'Mr. Theocharakis never characterised the technical teams of the institutions with the phrase attributed to him,' the ministry said in a statement. 'On the contrary ... he referred to them as saying they include 'top-notch people with impressive skills.'' Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas (pictured) said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time Germany's Spiegel Online quoted Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt as saying that Greece postponing the repayment due on April 9 was 'out of the question', otherwise a Greek exit from the eurozone could no longer be ruled out. He said the Eurogroup would not release further funds to Greece until Athens implemented some of the reforms it had promised. Athens has not received bailout funds since August last year and has resorted to measures such as borrowing from state entities via repo transactions to tide it through the cash crunch. The government is hoping approval of its latest reforms package will unlock remaining aid of 7.2 billion euros under its EU/IMF bailout and lead to the return of about 1.9 billion euros in profits made by the European Central Bank on Greek bonds.

Alison Hargreaves, 32, was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalayan mountain in 1995. Now her son Tom Ballard, one of the world's most accomplished climbers, plans to conquer K2 himself. Mr Ballard, 26, told The Times\u00a0that he saw it as his destiny to follow in his mother's footsteps. He said: 'I think it must be. At one stage I thought I would go and climb mountains for her. Then I realised that was actually a bit stupid because she had already climbed them herself. I realised I was climbing for myself. That's how I've gone on.' Last month Mr Ballard became the first to solo climb all six of the great north faces of the Alps in the winter season - and now he is training for K2. The climber was just six years old when his mother died while descending K2, which is regarded as more difficult to reach than the summit of Mount Everest, with dozens dying during attempts to reach the top. Days before her death, Mrs Hargreaves sent a fax to her son and his sister Katie. It read: 'Tom and Katie, We have arrived at our base camp. The trek was difficult \u2014 it snowed every day. The mountain I have come to climb is called K2.' Attached was a drawing of the 28,251ft mountain which would later claim her life. Mr Ballard's mother was a revered figure in the climbing world and was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen.

When she climbed the north face of the Eiger, in the Swiss Alps, in 1988, Mrs Hargreaves was pregnant with her son. Mr Ballard said he had clear memories of clambering over rocks as a child and had always known climbing was his calling. 'When I grew, I was always scrambling around on little rocks underneath the crags where my mum and dad climbed. A child, playing,' he said. 'At primary school I had something like an epiphany.

'German journalists are interested in my book, but they keep asking me whether I am doing something to make Germans out as victims, which is not allowed, it seems,' he reportedly told the newspaper. 'We have to think of ourselves as the bad guys, and it is still a controversial thing to suggest otherwise.' Crimes committed against ordinary Germans by the Allies and the millions that were left uprooted by war are also the subject of other tomes. The German city of Munich is today opening a new museum dedicated to exploring its past as the birthplace of the Nazi movement. The Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism charts the rise of the Nazi party from its founding in the Bavarian capital in 1920, a year before Adolf Hitler became its leader. German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters praised the city for tackling what she called 'the long repressed confrontation with the special role Munich played.' Gruetters noted that Germany's effort to examine its past - which encompassed World War II and the murder of millions the Nazis considered unworthy of life - is getting harder by the year because the number of witnesses is dwindling. Only nine per cent of Germans now consider the end of the conflict a defeat.

The software extracts the relevant colour information from images or artworks found online. The plot above is based on 94,526 images for the years 1800-2000. The graph shows a clear trend toward more blue paintings toward the end of the 20th Century, with all colours increasing except for orange. 'I made a visualization of the change in colors of paintings over time,' said Martin Bellander, a PhD student in psychology at the Karolinska Institute\u00a0who created the graph. To do this, he wrote software first to scrape the images of the paintings from sites where they were available for free download - BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. Then, the software extract the relevant colour information from them, and plots it in a nice way. He found the paintings change over time - from orange to blue. 'The changes in color might be a results of a combination of factor,' he wrote. 'One of these could of course be trends in the use of colour. 'If we assume a smooth linear deterioration of certain colours in oil paintings, it would be possible to subtract that change and study the short term fluctuation in colour use. 'For example the marked increase of blue at the time of the First World War, might actually reflect a true trend in colour use.' Two versions of Van Gogh's Sunflowers painting on show at the National Gallery in in London, England: Yellow and orange are the most popular colours in artworks from 1800, it has been found. Bellander used freely available images for the project. 'There are a bunch of different sites where you can access (photos of) paintings, \u00a0for instance the BBC, Google Art Project, Wikiart, Wikimedia commons, and various museums. .'One of my favorites is the BBC's site where you can browse through over 200K of well organized paintings - an amazing resource. 'For many of these there is also information on the year they were painted, the artist, etc.' He believes that some experts who have claimed perhaps the change is due top the price of paint are wrong. 'I haven\u2019t found any data on the prices of blue, so that explanation is hard to elaborate on. 'However, it is not only blue that increases but all colors except orange, which might speak against the pigment prices explanation.

Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing.

FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known\u00a0as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

Grant Allen, 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled first class around the world with his girlfriend\u00a0Gaynor Godwin and bought a holiday home on the Costa Del Sol, Spain, using criminally gained money. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing \u00a330,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth \u00a37,600. Grant Allen (left), 38, of Harlow, Essex, travelled round the world with his girlfriend, Gaynor Godwin (right) using money from a mortgage fraud scam. Edward Byatt (behind Allen, left) was also involved in the fraud Allen also splurged \u00a38,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World. The Old Bailey heard that he hid the fraud by buying and trading properties and funnelling large amounts of cash through his unwitting girlfriend's bank account. The couple lived in a \u00a3700,000 home in Rayne, Essex - where \u00a333,000 was spent on landscaping the garden - and also owned a property in Hertfordshire, bought with the proceeds of the fraud. When the home in Essex was raided in 2011, detectives found large piles of cash including \u00a31,000 which was stashed in the extractor fan in the kitchen. Judge Stephen Kramer QC today ordered Allen to pay back \u00a3491,000 as the proceeds of crime. Allen, who was jailed for six years for mortgage fraud and money laundering, could face another three years behind bars if he fails to pay the money back. Allen splurged \u00a38,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World However, the court heard he has assets including homes in Essex, Bishop Stortford, and southern Spain which he can sell to cover the repayment. A second defendant, Edward Byatt, 39, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, was ordered to pay back \u00a310,000 for his part in the fraud. His name was on the deeds for the home in Rayne, despite Allen living there with Ms Godwin and their young son. \u2018Grant Allen used other people in the laundering process. He is somehow involved in criminal behaviour,\u2019 prosecutor Charles Evans told the trial in 2013. \u2018The money would have been criminal proceeds.\u2019 During his trial, Allen claimed he worked as a meat trader and a builder, and suggested his funds had come from successful gambling ventures.

But there's one sight the becomes most engrained in the memories of even the most seasoned traveller - the wacky things people carry on the back of a motorbike or scooter. Lee Thompson's seen plenty in his 14 years as an award-winning photojournalist covering the civil war in Libya, the revolution in Egypt, the tsunami in Japan and other extensive travels before he co-founded The Flash Pack, a small group flashpacking tour company. But even he repeatedly marvels at what the men and women of southeast Asia can balance and transport on just a scooter or a beaten up old motorcycle, and on one of his company's\u00a0Vietnam & Cambodia\u00a0tours with a group of nine this month he was compelled to capture some of the finest. There's seemingly no measure to what can be packed onto the back of a bike or scooter in southeast Asia The Flash Pack's Lee Thompson captured this man with scores of live chickens in weaved baskets this month in Sapa, Vietnam That's one way to pop a wheelie! A man pulls a packed trailer from a loading dock at the Mekong river crossing in Vietnam with a motorbike In this series of images from a single 14-day trip, he photographs a man casually puffing on a cigarette and carrying what looks like more than 20 live chickens in woven cages perched on the back of his scooter\u00a0in Sapa, Vietnam. At a Mekong river crossing in Vietnam he is there to watch a motorcyclist dragging a massive trailer out of a boat loading dock on a bike, with the load so heavy he continuously pops wheelies, all the while not in the slightest bit bothered his two wheels have become one. Thompson enjoys the fact that what looks quirky to a Brit is simply every day life for the locals. In Vietnam alone there are more than 37 million motorbikes or scooters, most definitely the vehicle of choice in traffic that would make western country's peak hours look tame. 'Unlike other tour companies we venture in to remote parts of Sapa where it's not unusual to see bikes carrying livestock like chickens, pigs and goats - it makes really great photographs but it's just a way of life for the locals,' said Thompson. In Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, all that's needed to move some large piles of chairs is two wheels and some clever  packing Getting around on two wheels is a way of life in Vietnam where there are more than 37 million motorbikes (and only a few million cars) 'I watched as one of the bikers tried to work out how he would carry eight goats on his bike, he fell three times before he finally got going and the goats didn't seem to happy about it!' A family of five and a smiling group of four adults pile onto scooters to get from A to B while another transport a giant pile of chairs stacked on a tray from one side of the city to the other with the power of just his humble two-wheeler. With limited resources comes innovation, as is evident with one mother who has attached a cane high chair to the front of her vehicle to make it more comfortable for her to transport her toddler around town in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 'Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh are full of bikes and it makes the morning commute in London seem easy,' Thompson said. 'Even though most of our group was very well travelled the amount of bikes on the road still comes as a shock in these amazing countries - it's crazy!' A mother fits a high chair is onto the front of a scooter for her toddler in this shot captured in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam A bike that's seen better days carrying pigs is not an unusual sight on the road to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, says Thompson A family drive is a cosy affair for this five-some packed onto a scooter  in Hanoi The man on the back of this scooter in Hanoi, Vietnam, holds a ladder and some building materials as they weave their way through traffic Thompson says the eight goats in the cage on the back on this bike 'didn't seem happy' as the rider tipped them over three times The commute in Vietnam makes the daily battle on the Tube that Londoners endure look easy, but they don't seem to mind The morning commute in Ho Chi Minh City is certainly less stuffy than piling into the Tube on a Monday morning And here are some more unique uses for scooters... An assortment of exotic fish are in bags and ready for sale, cleverly attached to this man's scooter, in H\u1ea1 Long Bay, Vietnam A basket vendor balances an array of products on the back of this small motorised bike in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam There's only one way to transport a bike that isn't working in Vietnam ... on the back of one of the country's 37 million bikes or scooters", "candidate_sentences": ["The Flash Pack's Lee Thompson captured some of the wacky things people carry on the back of a motorbike or scooter in southeast Asia.", "In Vietnam alone there are more than 37 million motorbikes or scooters, most definitely the vehicle of choice in traffic that would make western country's peak hours look tame."], "candidate_words": [["The", "Flash", "Pack's", "Lee", "Thompson", "captured", "some", "of", "the", "wacky", "things", "people", "carry", "on", "the", "back", "of", "a", "motorbike", "or", "scooter", "in", "southeast", "Asia."], ["In", "Vietnam", "alone", "there", "are", "more", "than", "37", "million", "motorbikes", "or", "scooters,", "most", "definitely", "the", "vehicle", "of", "choice", "in", "traffic", "that", "would", "make", "western", "country's", "peak", "hours", "look", "tame."]], "intrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "extrinsic_hallucinations": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]}

He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. \"He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,\" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a \"guerilla satirist.\" The New York Times dubbed him the \"Che Guevara of advertising,\" and years later, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. \"Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,\" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. \"RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend.\" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. \"Wun'erful Wun'erful,\" his 1957 spoof of \"champagne music\" \u2014 on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May \u2014 lampooned \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit \"Cry,\" which Freberg rendered as \"Try.\" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including \"St. George and the Dragonet,\" a 1953 send-up of the series \"Dragnet.\" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, \"That's Rich.\" Three years later, he presented \"The Stan Freberg Show\" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: \"Mad Men's\" return He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for \"The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows.\" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy \"Time for Beany,\" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an \"office\" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show \"Toast of the Town.\" Hollywood Reporter: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" -- the untold story Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as \"Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,\" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in \"Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was \"More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,\" and he even had a corporate motto: \"Ars Gratia Pecuniae\" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon \"What's Brewin', Bruin,\" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's \"Three Little Bops.\" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's \"Lady and the Tramp\" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, \"Back in Action\" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear.

Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with abusive messages over the internet after she tried to end their relationship in October last year. A court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on to her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that\u00a0the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant,\u00a0saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she\u00a0'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. She said: 'He started setting up different profiles on Facebook to send me messages. He also sent my family messages and my friends messages because he couldn't get to me. 'I was very upset, it drove me insane, it made me depressed. I'm on medication. 'His language was absolutely disgusting. He was asking me why I wasn't playing any more, calling me names.' The victim said Cotterill found pictures of her on the internet that he threatened to send to her family and friends. He sent more than one to her daughter, she said. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes In October last year, Cotterill sent the victim a link to an x-rated explicit video with a message that said: 'F**k it, I'm going to have it as my profile picture'. He also taunted the victim on Facebook, telling her: 'I am going to send some more pictures too because it's fun lol.' The 42-year-old was 'driven insane' and suffered depression and panic attacks after Cotterill spent a year sending 'disgusting' messages. David Houldcroft, defending, said Cotterill, who had two previous\u00a0convictions for harassment, accepted sending the link and that it would have caused her upset. Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim 'He regrets that and understands that he has problems with relationships,' Mr Houldcroft said. 'He suffers from depression and has alcohol issues. He\u00a0recognises that he needs help.' Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found\u00a0guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting\u00a0his victim. District Judge David Robinson said: 'You harassed the complainant over a\u00a0three-month period and used social networks constantly in a threatening\u00a0manner to get her to re-engage with you. 'There are a number of aggravating features in this case. 'You sought to use dozens of Facebook profiles to get in touch with her,\u00a0you also found a link to a pornographic site and made use of that. 'You either involved or threatened to involve others, sending the link to\u00a0the woman's friends and her sister, insinuating that her children might get\u00a0to see the photos.

In Aintree's crowded unsaddling area, the former England captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number '3', with his wife, Zara Phillips, scampering in hot pursuit. Not even a hug from AP McCoy could check his momentum. No wonder. Tindall was beaming from ear-to-ear having just seen Monbeg Dude, the horse whom he owns with James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson, run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior, who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1, returned. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall and wife Zara Philipps at Aintree ahead of the Grand National Tindall celebrates after watching his horse\u00a0Monbeg Dude finish third in the National Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost \u00a312,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. Here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the Crabbie's Grand National. The \u00a388,400 was by far the biggest pot Monbeg Dude has collected in his 24-race career but the reactions of Tindal et al (ITALICISE) showed this was about far more than money. 'Pride is the word I would use,' said Michael Scudamore. 'I am so happy for the horse. He is unbelievably tough and brave. To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow. But what a great day. I really appreciate everything about this atmosphere now.' He wasn't the only one.

In an op-ed published by The New York Times on Wednesday,  Nick Loeb explained his rationale for fighting to keep the two female embryos he shares with the actress. \"I wanted to keep this private, but recently the story broke to the world,\" Loeb wrote. \"It has gotten attention not only because of the people involved -- my ex is Sofia Vergara, who stars in the ABC series \"Modern Family\" -- but also because embryonic custody disputes raise important questions about life, religion and parenthood.\" Loeb says he met the actress in 2010 and they got engaged two years later, at which point they decided to create the embryos and conceive a child via a surrogate. After two attempts failed to bring fertilized embryos to term, they created two more embryos using her eggs and his sperm. \"When we create embryos for the purpose of life, should we not define them as life, rather than as property?,\" he said. \"... A woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects. Shouldn't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects?\" Loeb said he filed a complaint against the 42-year-old actress to prevent her from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. He filed it in August in Santa Monica, California, where they apparently lived while they dated. \"We signed a form stating that any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties' consent. The form did not specify -- as California law requires -- what would happen if we separated,\" he said. \" I am asking to have it voided.\" Representatives for Vergara have declined to comment in the past. Loeb has said he believes \"life begins at fertilization\" and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term. He said he doesn't want any money from the egg donor. The case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos. Typically, a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority, said fertility specialist Dr. David Tourgeman, who's not involved in this case. \"Usually when embryos are created, whether the couple is married or just consenting adults, there's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos, if they are frozen for future use,\" he said.

Nancy Perry will no longer teach students at Dublin Middle School and will retire at the end of the year, city schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter announced on Tuesday. Perry is alleged to have told students that Obama is a Muslim and that any parent who support him couldn't be Christian, either. Nancy Perry, left, won't teach again at Dublin Middle School in Georgia after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and parent Jimmie Scott complained A 12-year-old boy in Perry's class brought the matter to the attention of his father, Jimmie Scott, who complained to the school. 'If your parents voted for Obama, they're evil and I don't see how your parents could vote for someone that's Muslim' he told WMAZ, paraphrasing Perry's alleged comments. Scott said he immediately requested a parent-teacher conference to which Perry brought along her husband Bill, who sits on the county Board of Education. Instead of discussing Nancy Perry's classroom comments, Scott says that she and her husband showed him what he described as internet propaganda. 'She showed it to me and said, \"See, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old as they're coming through the birth canal.\"' Superintendent Ledbetter said Perry was already planning on retiring before the complaint about her behavior. 'On behalf of the School District, we want to apologize to the student and to his parents,' he said at a school board meeting. Scott said he requested a parent-teacher conference, but Nancy Perry brought along her husband Bill, pictured above, who sites on the Board of Education. \u00a0The pair showed him what he described as anti-Obama internet propaganda City schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter says school principals are now required to call the superintendent if any board member asks to sit in on parent-teacher meetings 'It is not the place of teachers to attempt to persuade students about religious or political beliefs.' Scott also addressed the community at the meeting, saying his family had been ridiculed and had racial slurs thrown at them. Scott is black and Perry is white. 'We've lost loved ones in the community because a line was drawn,' Scott said. 'Either you were for my son or you were for the teacher.' Ledbetter also apologized for the actions of Perry's husband, who he said shouldn't have attended the parent-teacher conference.

Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture.

And by 2060, immigrants could account for 82 per cent of all population growth in the country. One in seven U.S. residents will be an immigrant by 2023, the report from the Center for Immigration Studies\u00a0(CIS) said. Documented and undocumented immigrants in the United States could reach a record high in the United States by 2023, when their share of the population could hit 14.8 per cent That number could rise to one in five by 2060, when immigrant population reaches 78 million. This report comes as President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand\u00a0Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) policies. Net immigration will steadily increase over the next 45 years, totaling at 64million Without no change in current immigration policy, by 2023 the total immigrant population in the United states will reach 14.8 per cent, the highest ever recorded in American history Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population and will reach 15.8 per cent of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent by 2060 In 1990, immigrants accounted for just 7.9 per cent of U.S. population U.S population could grow to 417million by 2016. In 2010 the population was 306million Without a change to immigration policty, immigrants who arrive in the future and their descendants could account for three quarters of future U.S. population Center for Immigration Studies This could potentially exempt about five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. And with the surge in immigrant population, Republican presidential candidates have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established. CIS director of research Steven Camarota said that the growth in immigrant population has 'important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment'. 'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner. There are also more than 4.4million people on a U.S. State Department green card waiting list. And within years, Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population. From a starting point of 2010, immigration population will reach 15.8 per cent (57million) of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 (65million) per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent (78million) \u00a0by 2060. Immigrants and their descendants will account for 75.5 per cent of the nation's population growth between 2010 and 2050 and 82 per cent of growth between 2010 and 2060. By 2060, immigrants and their descendants will account for 82 per cent of the nation's population growth since 2010 President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand immigration policies, which\u00a0could potentially exempt about 5million undocumented immigrants from deportation Alabama Rep. Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has been a leader in the immigration debate, said in a letter to the New York Times on Saturday that an increase of immigrants in the country will hurt the middle class. He wrote: 'It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. 'Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?'

The 44-year-old from Oldham decided had just returned from Algeria and wanted to complain about the temperatures he experienced during his holiday. Police tweeted the anecdote after the man tried to lodge an official complaint at the Great Manchester Police Chadderton division. Great Manchester Police Chadderton division revealed a man lodged a complaint that the weather on his holiday was 'too hot' The incident was shared by the police press office on its Facebook page, along with a warning that members of the public should not waste police time. There was a warning that such an offence can carry a maximum punishment of six months' imprisonment and/or a fine. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police told MailOnline Travel: 'The male was advised that this was not a police problem.' Following the post being shared on Facebook, there were mixed reactions to the man's actions. Janine Gamblen wrote: 'Some people really are just stupid,' while Sarah Edwards added: 'Only in Oldham.' The 44-year-old man had recently returned to the UK from a holiday in Algeria (file photo) 'The mind boggles,' commented Tracy Ayre while Suzi Force believes the man should have been punished, saying: 'Give him a holiday in a cell, maybe he will think twice next time!' However, Joanne Parker made light of the incident writing: 'Haha funny...would love to have seen the police face.' The current temperatures in Algeria is 28C, and this has remained fairly constant over the last week or two. Temperatures are set to peak at 25C over the next three days in England, however the north will see slightly lower temperatures than the south.

Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his phone in the middle of a match. The two-time national champion was exposed when his opponent lodged a complaint when he grew suspicious about his frequent trips to the lavatory. Tournament organisers found Nigalidze had stored a mobile phone in a cubicle, covered in toilet paper. They announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page. The complaint was made by Nigalidze's opponent in their sixth-round match in the tournament, Armenia's Tigran Petrosian. He said: 'Nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet. 'I noticed that he would always visit the same toilet partition, which was strange, since two other partitions weren't occupied. 'I informed the chief arbiter about my growing suspicions and asked him to keep an eye on Gaioz. 'After my opponent left the very toilet partition yet another time, the arbiters entered it. 'What they found was the mobile phone with headphones; the device was hidden behind the pan and covered with toilet paper.' Tournament organisers at the Dubai Open Chess tournament\u00a0announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page When officials confronted the Georgian, he denied owning the device but officials found the phone was logged into a social networking site under his name. They also found his match being analysed in one of the chess applications. He was promptly removed from the tournament and could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game. When questioned about the offence,\u00a0Nigalidze said: 'Not everything is true in what Petrosian said'. This is not the first time a player was caught cheating at a chess tournament. In July 2013, Bulgarian player Borislav Ivanov was suspended from playing for four months by his national federation. It had been found most of his moves matched those of the leading computer chess analysis programs. Two years earlier the French chess federation suspended three players, including the national team captain, when it was alleged they used text messages, a remote chess computer and coded signals to beat the opposition at the 2010 Chess Olympiad. In 2008, at the Dubai Open, an Iranian player was banned when he was found to be receiving help from someone watching the game's live broadcast on the internet and was sending the moves through text messages.
