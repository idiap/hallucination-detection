Fiorentina had one foot in the next stage of Europe's second tier cup competition thanks to Khouma Babacar's all-important away goal during the closing stages of last Thursday's first leg encounter in Kiev. The Ukrainian outfit knew they were in for a hard task at the Stadio Artemio Franchi as they faced the likes of Mohamed Salah, Joaquin and Gomez. Fiorentina ace Mario Gomez scored the opening goal of the game in the 43rd minute to help his side qualify . The home side celebrate after Gomez's fortunate shot lands in the back of\u00a0Oleksandr Shovkovskiy's net . Dynamo Kiev's Jeremain Lens was given his marching orders shortly before the interval for an apparent dive .

Booked: Lens . Sent off: Lens 40 . Referee: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden) And their mission to seal a spot in the next round was made near enough impossible due to an incredibly rash decision by Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson. The Scandinavian official ruined Dynamo Kiev's hopes of upsetting the Viola by brandishing a red card in the direction of Holland international Jeremain Lens. Eriksson showed Lens a second yellow card as he decided to penalise the former PSV forward for diving inside the penalty area. The wrong call was made as replays showed Lens was slightly clipped when he made his way towards goal. It was one of those occasions where the referee should have simply let play continue. Dynamo Kiev manager and former Tottenham striker Sergei Rebrov was forced into taking off striker Lukasz\u00a0Teodorczyk moments before the interval, which subsequently minimised the away side's goal threat during the second half. Salah, who has proven his doubters wrong since swapping Chelsea for Fiorentina in February, almost doubled his side's lead when he managed to jiggle his way past several defenders before shooting at goal. The Egyptian international's shot appeared to be heading into the back of Oleksandr Shovkovskiy's net until Danilo used his hand to intercept. Dynamo Kiev, despite their best efforts, failed to really threaten Fiorentina after being reduced to 10 men as Vincenzo Montella's side elected to play the passing game. Late substitute Vargas put the result beyond doubt when he ran down the left wing before smashing the ball past\u00a0Shovkovskiy. Fiorentina will face either Napoli, Sevilla or Dnipro for a place in this year's Europa League final in Warsaw.

All of them are adopting or advocating for hiring practices that open up work opportunities for people with convictions and leverage untapped potential in the labor market. Koch Industries' recent announcement that it will \"ban the box\" -- i.e., remove from its job applications the check-box that asks about convictions -- is a big step forward in the movement to break down barriers to employment for job-seekers with records. \"Ban the box\" doesn't prohibit background checks, it only postpones them until later in the hiring process. It's one item on a menu of fair-chance hiring reforms intended to ensure that job applicants are evaluated on their skills and qualifications first, rather than judged solely on past mistakes. These policies help reduce recidivism by making employment accessible to job-seekers who need a second chance, and they help break down the stigma of an arrest or conviction record. Two generations of the war on drugs, zero tolerance, and aggressive policing have left 70 million adults  with arrest or conviction records that undermine their ability to be considered for jobs, even as the job market has grown steadily. Millions of people are being left behind, and it's taking a toll on our economy: The reduced economic output of people with records cost our economy $57-$65 billion in 2008 alone. These criminal justice policies disproportionately impact African-Americans, who are incarcerated at a rate six times that of whites. The Department of Justice's recent investigation of the Ferguson Police Department, for example, shows the extent to which racism is perpetuated through police departments and the court system. That systemic racial disparity is then repeated throughout the economy, and the community is put at a severe disadvantage in the job market long after individuals have served their time. That's one reason the African-American unemployment rate is persistently twice that of whites. In a job market where employers that didn't previously do background checks now make them a routine part of hiring, qualified job-seekers are being screened out of the applicant pools for more and more jobs. Nearly one in three adults in America has an arrest or conviction history that will show up on a routine background check. Companies like Koch, Walmart, Target, and Bed Bath & Beyond recognize that this is a huge source of untapped talent, and that's why they've already banned the box on their job applications. These policies are also gaining traction with politicians across the political spectrum. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently signed executive orders removing the conviction question from initial applications for state employment. So far, 16 states and more than 100 cities and counties have adopted fair-chance hiring policies. Six of those states and the District of Columbia, plus 25 cities and counties, have applied their policies to government contractors or private employers as well. The Obama administration took an important step toward fairer and smarter federal hiring practices last year when it issued an executive order prohibiting contractors from discriminating against LGBT individuals. Banning the box and other common-sense hiring reforms would build on that progress and on the successful work of governors and the corporate sector. The administration should ensure that the federal government does not continue to erect unfair and unnecessary barriers to employment of people with records. Already, more than 200 organizations and prominent individuals have publicly urged the Obama administration to take these practical steps. If Koch Industries -- a major federal contractor -- can ban the box, there's no reason why other federal contractors cannot. Now it's time for President Obama to lead the way and embrace fair-chance hiring of people with records.", "candidate": "Koch Industries is the latest company to remove a box from job applications that asks about convictions.

Now the best-selling author is on a mission to spread her colourful ethos with her new style bible, aptly named Colour. 'The ability of colour to transfrom surroundings, to excite, inspire, tantalise and calm, is second to none!' enthuses Ahern, who says walking into her own colourful home gives her a 'squishy feeling of contentment' everyday. Abigail Ahern described the colours used by Kelly Wearstler in her Malibu beachhouse as 'the most beautiful and complex I\u2019ve ever seen' Ahern says of this Miami home: 'Inspired by a natural palette \u2013 silvery greys, driftwood taupes, watery greens and storm cloud greys \u2013 it\u2019s what you might call glammed-up neutrals. I adore!' The designer says: 'I assure you white hallways wouldn't have the same effect!' So her message to anyone looking to transform their home is to ditch the beige, stop procrastinating and be bold with colour. The inspirational photographs in the book, which Ahern describes as displaying a 'virtuosic talent of colour',\u00a0come from homes across the world. But if recreating these stylish spaces seems an overwhelming task, in an extract from her new book, here are the designer's top ten tips to colour confidence. 'You don\u2019t have to overdose on colour to take your pad to the next level. Layer on texture instead,' says Ahern of this look . 'The soft gold kitchen cabinets in Jean-Louis Deniot\u2019s Parisian pad (opposite) left me speechless. To master the metallic look, bear in mind that there is a fine line between adding pieces that instantly brighten a room and going overboard so that your space begins to feel like a nightclub,' says Ahern . 1. Start by picking a colour for your biggest room \u2013 say your living room or kitchen. Choose a hue that feels beautiful and inspiring, and true to what you love. Build on this to create a limited palette of colours for your entire home, using different combinations of those colours in each room. 2. Use an existing feature in your pad to inspire the basis of your colour scheme. This could be a view from the window, a work of art or any favourite item you own. 3. Think about what you want from your home to\u00a0communicate to the outside world. No one will be talking about your beige-on-beige home, so go a little crazy. Be reckless, I say! The more your confidence grows, the more you\u2019ll feel like experimenting with colour. 4. Be brave! To start with, decorating with colour can seem like a daunting task. Colour behaves differently according to where you put it. The effect changes again once you add lighting, pattern, texture and greenery into the mix. I think this is why people favour whites over any other colour group, as they distort less when other elements are thrown into the mix. However, to me, this is a bit like decorating by numbers. Too easy! Bold hues, on the other hand, make everything on display feel grander, cooler, more intense, with beautiful undertones subtly changing in the daylight. You\u2019ll never look back! Left: 'Subvert expectations with a fresh take on a classic combo,' says Ahern of this black and white corner . Ahern advises, 'Painting a room out in a dark hue automatically makes it feel cosy, den-like and snug' 5. Remember, there are no no-nos. Well almost none. Pastels are one grouping I never want to work with. But then plop me in Miami and I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be instantly seduced! 6. Use colour in unexpected places . Behind closed doors, inside kitchen cupboards, bedroom wardrobes, the loo \u2013 all those tucked away places that surprise the minute you enter. 7. Remember the small stuff. Introduce colour through cushions, vases, bowls, fruit, greenery \u2013 you name it. There should be splashes everywhere for your eye to alight on! An inky palette with a shot of warm yellow is a marriage made in heaven. The yellow warms up the darker hue, Ahern says . 'To avoid your scheme looking and feeling dull, adding oodles of texture and the odd pop of colour' 8. All colour schemes are improved by accents: the final touches of colour that add an element of surprise, and bring rooms to life. There are no fixed rules when it comes to choosing these; just take care with the amount of colour you use and where you use it. As fab as that bright orange might look on a pillow, it may not feel quite so amazing on four walls because the impact will be so much stronger. 9. Patterns provide necessary punctuation; don\u2019t neglect them. They anchor a space like nothing else I know. 10. Create the illusion of space by blurring the boundaries between walls and ceilings. Paint them all out the same colour and suddenly you\u2019ve made your space a zillion times bigger. Promise! 'Clever finishing touches, like this whimsical wallpaper, revitalise rooms,' she says .

Back in the chill of mid-December, Ally McCoist led the Ibrox side here on the day it emerged he had handed in his notice of resignation. A convincing 2-0 defeat did nothing to alleviate the mood of gloomy chaos that had engulfed the club. Nine days later, McCoist was out on gardening leave. Fast forward almost five months, and Rangers arrived here in far more ebullient spirits with a new boardroom regime installed and three successive victories under McCall\u2019s command. That Hibs and Hearts were among the victims added to the sense of a substantial revival. In Dumfries, however, it felt more like a flashback to the bad old days of their campaign. Rangers were simply second-best all over the plastic pitch in Dumfries . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park .

Booked: Templeton, Moshni . Ref: Don Robertson . Att: 5,093 . Immense credit must go to Queens, who recorded a thoroughly merited victory that has significantly boosted their play-off hopes. Under James Fowler, they are capable of bright, energetic football that delivered goals from Derek Lyle and Gavin Reilly, as well an own goal from Lee Wallace. McCall, though, must have felt a twinge of despair. He has spent much of his recent time emphasising that nothing had been achieved by the recent uplift. That so much work still had to be done were they to achieve their aim of promotion. A first defeat of his six-game reign confirmed that assessment in the most emphatic fashion. The Ibrox outfit remain third behind Hibs on goal difference, albeit with a game still in hand. Radical improvement is once again required when they host Raith Rovers on Sunday. Queens will face Falkirk at that same time, having just overhauled their key rivals for the fourth and final play-off spot. This was the best possible fillip for Fowler\u2019s men, as they seek to grow that one-point advantage. Ranger's Newcastle loanee Haris Vukic (left) attempts to block a shot by\u00a0QOTS' Chris Higgins . New manager Stuart McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club . Rangers were without suspended skipper Lee McCulloch \u2013 banned after a red card for an elbow on Hearts\u2019 Osman Sow at the weekend \u2013 which meant a starting role for Bilel Mohsni alongside Marius Zaliukas at the heart of the defence. There was little to trouble either backline in the initial exchanges, as the game developed at a rather sedate pace. McCall watched it unfold pensively. Clearly, what he was seeing wasn\u2019t to his liking. His side did have flickers of threat early on, but they often owed much to fortune. Andy Murdoch saw a mis-hit cross clawed out by Zander Clark, before a similar delivery from David Templeton looped fractionally over. The winger was another change to McCall\u2019s line-up and he saw plenty of the ball before the break, without making it amount to a great deal.

Lyle (centre) wheels away after putting the hosts in front with a strike on 33minutes . One neat bit of skill saw him drift infield from the left flank before thumping a shot just too high. Another powerful swipe was blocked by Andy Dowie\u2019s head \u2013 at the expense of ringing ears. Queens had offered even less up front throughout this spell, but suddenly sprang into life to claim the lead after 33 minutes with pretty much their first serious attack. Daniel Carmichael swept play wide to Lewis Kidd who took on Wallace. The Ibrox left-back toppled, apparently looking for a foul that wasn\u2019t there, allowing Kidd to break into the penalty area. His cut-back found Lyle, who took a touch on his left foot before dispatching a sweet finish off his right. The home fans roared approval, barely having time to draw breath before the advantage was very nearly doubled. Lyle set up Reilly and his daisy-cutter drew a fine stop from Lee Robinson at full stretch. The QOTS striker acknowledges the home supporters after making the score 1-0 in the first half . Play continues as a flare is let off in the Rangers section of the crowd at Palmerston Park . QOTS goalkeeper Zander Clark ensures Rangers' Bilel Mohsni does not find the back of the net . Rangers used the shock to stir them into greater vigour. Nicky Clark was close with a brave effort from a Darren McGregor cross, which led to him being flattened by his namesake in the Queens goal. Then, after a Haris Vuckic corner caused uncertainty, Kenny Miller sent a looping header against the bar. The first half duly closed with a penalty shout from Wallace after he tangled with Mark Durnan. Referee Don Robertson remained unmoved. Far worse followed for Wallace 16 seconds after the restart as he got the final touch to his side\u2019s second concession of the evening. Kidd celebrates after forcing an own goal from Rangers Lee Wallace immediately after the break . QOTS's Gavin Reilly (left) demonstrates a calm finish to put his side 3-0 to the good . Ibrox minds still appeared to be in the dressing room as Reilly surged into the box and sent a low cross speeding through the six yard box. It reached Kidd beyond the far post, who angled a drive back towards goal. Off balance, Wallace attempted to clear from the line but only succeeded in helping the ball into the net via his heel. Rangers were rocking. They looked shaken by the energy of their hosts. Fowler\u2019s side seemed to be first to the ball in every area. Templeton collected a booking for diving after attempting to go past Durnan, but creating clear chances remained a trickier task. Not long after, the winger was replaced by Robbie Crawford. Clark saw a deflected effort held, before a Mohnsi effort from distance was shuttled round the post. Yet there still wasn\u2019t a convincing edge to these attacking forays. The fluidity witnessed against Hearts at the weekend had disappeared. Scott Hooper applauds the home support as he leaves the field followed by dejected Rangers players . Queens were now content to try and pick Rangers off when they could. And they notched their clinching third goal after 69 minutes. Holt nicked possession away from Crawford and worked a little exchange that released Reilly. The flag stayed down as he calmly slotted beyond Robinson. Rangers attempted a pride-saving late flurry but found Clark in excellent form in the home goal. Notable saves from Vuckic and substitute Kris Boyd ensured McCall\u2019s side would exit without even a sliver of consolation.", "candidate": "Derek Lyle opened the scoring for Queen of the South in the 33rd minute.

It follows the 87-year-old honorary president of the far-right party falling out with Ms Le Pen, the current leader, over his extreme views. She was particularly angry that Mr Le Pen, a convicted racist and anti-Semite, called the Nazi gas chambers 'a detail of history'. Outage: Jean-Marie Le Pen angered his daughter when he said Nazi gas chambers were 'a detail of history' Anger: The 87-year-old has now said his Marine - the leader of the Front Nationale - 'may want him dead' But, in response to suggestions he should step down from his position, Mr Le Pen told RTL radio it was a 'crazy idea'. Mr Le Pen explained: 'The prestige that I obviously still have within the National Front would cause a considerable stir, and a loss of influence for Marine that she probably doesn't gauge.' He added: 'Marine Le Pen may want me dead, that's possible, but she must not count on my co-operation.' In an interview on Wednesday, Mr Le Pen flamed allegations of anti-Semitism by praising the wartime leader Marshall Phillippe Petain, who collaborated with the Nazis. Mr Le Pen also said that France's Spanish-born Socialist Prime Minister was an 'immigrant' and so unfit to run the country. And he made it clear that he was 'nostalgic' for the days when Algeria, the biggest country in Africa, was French. Stubborn: However, Mr Le Pen has refused to step down as honorary president of the far right party . Ms Le Pen took over the National Front (FN) from her father in 2011, and has tried to purge it of its extremists. Furious with her father's latest outburst, his daughter said she would oppose his candidacy in December elections to lead the southeastern Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region. She said his 'scorched earth strategy' of causing maximum public outrage amounted to 'political suicide'. 'The FN doesn't want to be held hostage to his vulgar provocations,' said Ms Le Pen, adding: 'His aim is to harm.' Denier: Mr Le Pen is known for his anti-semitic views, and was found guilty of Holocaust denial in 2008 . In an interview with Rivarol magazine, Mr Le Pen stood by his gas chambers remark, saying: 'I am not the type of man who changes his mind or crawls.' In a poll published last year, 83 per cent of French described Mr Le Pen as a handicap to his daughter as she fights to become president in 2017. The party has enjoyed immense electoral success over the past year, winning 25 per cent of the popular vote in local and European elections a year ago. Socialist Party leader Jean-Christophe Cambadelis suggesting the in-fighting exposes the true nature of the FN, saying: 'Jean-Marie Le Pen says out loud what many FN leaders, members and even voters think. 'Behind all that lies a political debate: should they keep what sets the far-Right apart or hide it to win elections? Marine Le Pen has chosen to hide it, Jean-Marie to affirm it.'", "candidate": "Jean-Marie Le Pen, 87, said his daughter Marine 'may want me dead' He was angered when he called Nazi gas chambers 'a detail of history' Ms Le Pen is the current leader of France's far-right National Front party.

After a first win in eight, they are back in this consuming promotion race and that six-week wobble is no longer. Steele lapped up the adulation, entertaining 4,000 behind one goal of the DW Stadium at which the Rams wrapped up three crucial points. This felt very important indeed, the outpouring of each ol\u00e9 obvious. Derby's players celebrate after Chris Martin's goal gave them the lead in the second half . Steve McClaren was all smiles as he took his place in the stands before the game . Wigan (4-4-2): Al Habsi; Boyce (McCann 63), Maguire, Pearce, Bong; Bo-kyung, Kvist, Perch McClean; Clarke (Waghorn 75), Fortune (Murphy 65). Subs not used: Carson, Pennant, Barnett, Ojo. Booked: Boyce, Clarke . Derby (4-2-3-1): Grant; Keogh, Forsyth, Albentosa, Warnock (Christie 88); Hughes, Hendrick, Ward (Martin 46), Russell, Ince (Dawkins 90); Bent. Subs not used: Roos, Lingard, Whitbread, Hanson. Goals: Martin 51, Bent 81. Booked: Hughes, Hendrick. Referee: S. Hooper. Attendance: 14,697. Make no mistake, these have been tough times for Steve McClaren. Top of the tree back on February 24, the Derby manager is now only looking at promotion via the play-offs, labelling an automatic spot a \u2018long shot\u2019. Their ticket for those extra games is by no means booked, but goals from substitute Chris Martin and Darren Bent mean they are back on track. Martin climbed off the bench at half-time to change the game, slamming in the opener six minutes after the restart before Bent capitalised on shambolic defending to prod in a late second. \u2018I didn\u2019t think Chris would make the impact that he did,\u2019 McClaren admitted after Martin\u2019s first appearance in almost two months. \u2018He could only play 45 minutes. \u2018It\u2019s a massive win. Huge character. We showed the quality we\u2019ve been missing. The away following was absolutely incredible. We\u2019ve stuck together.\u2019 Wigan, by contrast, are staring at relegation and a first season in the third tier since 2003. Now eight points adrift, their fans chanted for the head of Malky Mackay. Chairman David Sharpe didn\u2019t know where to look at full-time and they need two wins from trips to Fulham and Millwall - on Friday and next Tuesday respectively - to stand any chance of survival. Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant does well to tip over a header from a Wigan corner . Derby winger Tom Ince has a low effort saved by Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi . Jeff Hendrick rides a challenge from South Korea international Kim Bo-kyung . \u2018It\u2019s still mathematically possible and we need to keep giving it everything we\u2019ve got,\u2019 Mackay said. \u2018It was criminal to miss those chances but that has haunted the club all season. \u2018I thought we were terrific first half - 17 crosses into their box. That should bring a return of two goals.\u2019 It did not, and Mackay\u2019s use of \u2018mathematical\u2019 tends to suggest the writing is on the wall. James McClean and Kim Bo-kyung both went close but Wigan ran out of steam, their fans streaming out after Bent\u2019s 81st-minute clincher. Kim shifted the ball to his left foot and found James McClean, storming towards the six-yard box but the winger\u2019s bullet header was met in stature by Lee Grant\u2019s splendid one-handed stop, tipping over while airborne. Tom Ince had the beating of his man inside the box, but could only fluff right-footed straight at Ali Al Habsi. Maguire almost put through his own net from a Jamie Ward corner but those two moments were all McClaren\u2019s side could muster before the break, finding the quagmire of a playing surface at the DW Stadium quite a deterrent. This had been used for the Warriors\u2019 win against St Helens in their Rugby League encounter on Good Friday, and you could tell; a tame Kim drive bobbled three times to test Grant when otherwise it would not have. But, frankly, that is the least of Wigan\u2019s worries. They face an almighty task to escape relegation, made all the harder when Martin linked up with Russell to score. \u2018The difference with him and without him shows you what a top striker can do,\u2019 Mackay rued. Chris Martin celebrates after giving Derby the lead in the crucial promotion clash . Grant saves at the feet of Leon Clarke as relegation-threatened Wigan press for a second-half equaliser . It\u2019s 20 for the season now and how they have missed the Scotland international\u2019s presence. He came on with purpose, knocked the normally immovable Maguire from pillar to post and gave the Rams a focus. Ince just poked over the bar after super build-up involving Martin and Bent, before the on-loan Aston Villa striker wrapped up the points after 81 minutes. Bent comes alive in the 18-yard box and reacted quickest to Jason Pearce\u2019s terrible mix-up to add a second. Wigan did have their chances. McClean was smothered brilliantly by Grant as the Ireland international looked to equalise; William Kvist then saw a half-volley superbly blocked by Hughes. They displayed guts, but not an awful lot of quality, and a first season below the top two divisions since 2003 looks to be the legacy created by Dave Whelan in controversially appointing Mackay. \u2018We want Malky out,\u2019 was the summation of 10,000 home fans.

{"id": "f7eee5291ea3abd99fcd7cc512022027e0402e4b-2", "article": "Only after the fourth goal had been scored, only after this derby demolition had been completed, did Louis van Gaal turn to the most expensive player in English football and the player who commands the highest wages. Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao were little more than fresh legs here on Sunday, and any success Van Gaal has enjoyed in his first season at Old Trafford needs to be measured against the difficulties two phenomenally talented players have endured. But it also a measure of the qualities the Dutchman possesses that players with only a fraction of their ability are not just keeping them out of the side, but are performing as well as this. Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao were left on the bench by Louis van Gaal on Sunday . Argentine \u00a360m man Di Maria came on for Juan Mata in the 81st minute at Old Trafford . Falcao replaced Belgian Marouane Fellaini with seven minutes to play in the win over Manchester City . A sixth successive Premier League victory that cements United in third place owes much to the revival of Ashley Young, Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata and the progress being made by Chris Smalling and Phil Jones. David Moyes once said Smalling and Jones were good enough to become England\u2019s central defensive pairing and Roy Hodgson, a spectator here on Sunday, is sure to be encouraged by their rate of development. In Young, Fellaini and Mata the transformation has been most startling, however, and credit has to go to Van Gaal for the way he has managed three players who were so central to the downfall of Moyes 12 months ago. In fairness to Fellaini, and indeed Moyes, the Belgian just needed time to make the transition from Everton to United. In fairness to Mata, he probably needed time, too, after being ejected from Chelsea by Jose Mourinho. Ashley Young celebrates after bringing Manchester United level having earlier trailed . But Young is a triumph for the style of leadership Van Gaal has long been recognised for: his ability to work with players on a personal basis as well as part of a collective. Even Van Gaal\u2019s critics recognise the skills that also made him a fine schoolteacher when he was supplementing his income as a poorly paid player in Holland with a career in education. He is clearly very good at restoring confidence and inspiring an individual, with Young finally looking like the player Martin O\u2019Neill used to admire so much. Young, one of five Englishmen in United\u2019s outfield 10, was the outstanding player in this hugely entertaining contest, scoring the equaliser that quickly cancelled out Sergio Aguero\u2019s opener, as well as providing the assists for Fellaini and Smalling, but more to the point, responding most effectively to what, presumably, were his manager\u2019s instructions. Fellaini headed in at the far post to give Manchester United the lead and continue his fine recent form . Mata slots under Joe Hart to extend Manchester United's lead to 3-1 early in the second half . Van Gaal would have seen how vulnerable City were to the aerial threat posed by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Monday and it was Young who delivered the crosses that enabled United\u2019s tallest players to punish them again, on both occasions with headers. Exactly why the issue had not been addressed by Manuel Pellegrini is anybody\u2019s guess. But if this game highlighted the skills of Van Gaal, it also illustrated where City\u2019s beleaguered manager has fallen short this season. While United are in the ascendancy, Pellegrini has overseen a period of decline for a stuttering City side. While United are now celebrating the renaissance of players like Young, Pellegrini faces the question of what on earth has happened to a side who were so superior to United a year ago. Chris Smalling headed in a free-kick to score Manchester United's fourth goal in the derby . England manager Roy Hodgson watched the Manchester derby from the stands at Old Trafford . 5 - Games lost by City in 2015, one more than the whole of 2014. 13 - City's position in the Premier League form table after losing four and winning two of his last six. 4 - The first time since losing 4-3 to United in 2009 that City have conceded four in the league. 9 - City have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season. 70.8 - City's pass completion rate percentage at Old Trafford was their worst of the season. It was a 3-0 win at Old Trafford that effectively finished Moyes at United, with the eventual champions moving 15 points clear of their neighbours that day with two games to spare. But this game was a microcosm of City\u2019s season: a decent start, marked by that first Aguero goal, and then a period of steady, draining decline. Since the turn of the year City have collected just 18 points from 13 games. Compare that to United, who have taken 29 from the same number of matches. Pellegrini was honest enough to admit that they have thrown away their title defence with the \u2018garbage\u2019 but the real garbage is on the pitch, in the form of some truly inept performances. Not least away from home. If Pellegrini had a desire to \u2018continue being noisy\u2019 and extend a period of dominance over their neighbours to a fifth league meeting, the evidence on Sunday would suggest it was not shared by his players. They were a poor imitation of the side that so impressed here last year. Nothing like the champions of England. Louis van Gaal shakes hands with his opposite number Manuel Pellegrini after the final whistle . Manchester United boss Van Gaal thanked supporters for their patience after Sunday's victory . Manchester City boss Pellegrini has come under increasing pressure after a dismal second half of the season . Compared to Chelsea, United are some way short of the best in England too and both clubs will need to invest heavily again this summer to close that gap. But this morning United and City appear to be travelling in opposite directions, one on the rise and the other entering another period of upheaval. Vincent Kompany blames financial fair play but overlooks the fact that Pellegrini has actually spent more than \u00a375million since last summer. Just as he ignores that the problem is closer to home; that he is chief among players operating on restricted power. At Old Trafford the drop in standards at City was obvious to all, and probably explained why the atmosphere was electric. United\u2019s supporters are enjoying seeing City suffer as much as they are now beginning to appreciate the leadership of Van Gaal. His management has taken on an almost magical quality. Judging by the fact that he can keep his two most expensive players on the bench for 80-odd minutes and nobody even notices.", "candidate": "Louis van Gaal left Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao on the bench.

A pub landlord convicted of showing Premier League football matches on foreign TV channels has won an eight-year legal battle to clear his name. Michael Thorpe says he has paid a heavy price for the lengthy fight to get his conviction quashed and has lost his pub as a result. Mr Thorpe, 55, was convicted of showing a Premier League game without having an agreement with official broadcasters in November 2006 at the Stoke Inn in Plymouth, Devon. He said he could not afford to pay Sky TV's rates for football matches, and opted instead to show Albanian transmissions of matches, which he says he thought was legal. But he was convicted, fined and ordered to pay costs eight years ago, when screening the matches was still treated as a criminal offence. Judge Recorder Nicolas Gerasimidis has now upheld his appeal and overturned the conviction following a landmark European court ruling. His appeal took so long as he had to launch the case  after the European Court of Justice found enforcing previous rules was anti-competitive. Mr Thorpe said he was 'overwhelmed' that a judge and magistrates had upheld his appeal after all this time. But it is a bitter-sweet victory, as the long-running dispute cost him his business and his livelihood. He said: 'We put a lot of money into that pub and it went from a thriving business to absolutely zero. People stopped coming to the pub, it cost me my business.' Mr Thorpe launched an appeal against his conviction soon after his trial, but the case was delayed by a similar test case which went as far as the European Court of Justice. The court ruled that having an exclusive system was a restraint of free trade and contrary to European Law. But the landlord says the court action has seen him lose the Stoke Inn in Plymouth which he used to run . Mr Thorpe's appeal was further delayed until another case involving Media Protection Services Ltd, the company which took him to court on behalf of the Premier League, but which no longer does so. Mr Thorpe was awarded his legal costs, which he paid privately, but he would not disclose the sum. The European court decision in 2012 cleared a landlady of a criminal conviction, but judges left the door open for court action against publicans by ruling pubs should get permission from the copyright owner before screening matches. The Premier League has since been taking landlords to civil courts for breaching copyright, with some ordered to pay up to \u00a365,000 in costs. The league sends teams of investigators to pubs around the country to try and catch those screening games illegally. Legal cases have  been brought against 250 bars and pubs during the current football season. He said he does not know whether he can retrieve the \u00a31,000 fine and \u00a31,500 costs ordered by the magistrates. Despite the decision, the Premier League has insisted pubs still cannot show foreign-TV footage of its games. Since the European Court decision, it is taking landlords to civil courts and suing them using copyright laws, which were not affected by the previous ruling. In 2012, pub Karen Murphy landlady won a landmark legal battle to overturn her conviction for using foreign decoders instead of Sky to show Premier League football matches. Ms Murphy, who ran The Red, White and Blue pub in Portsmouth, Hampshire, bought games through a Greek satellite broadcaster Nova for \u00a3800 a year instead of Sky, which was then priced at \u00a3700-a-month.

So why are Arsenal destined to sign off from another campaign celebrating a top-four finish and not a serious title challenge? Finish second they may well, but never have they entered the race for the top-flight crown. This term they are simply the best of the ragged rest, each with their flaws which have made the title tussle something of a \u2018no contest\u2019. Arsenal celebrate after a fine strike from Alexis Sanchez put them 3-0 up against Liverpool on Saturday . This is the most impressive team the Gunners have boasted since the dying embers of the Invincibles side of more than a decade ago. They have pace, power, energy and invention in attack \u2013 and that is just Alexis Sanchez. At the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since New Year\u2019s Day. But their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them, again. This year, however, is a reverse of previous seasons. More recently we have built up Arsene Wenger\u2019s side as title challengers until the arrival of spring, only for it all to fall flat. Arsene Wenger watches on as his side cruise to a stylish win over their rivals for a top-four spot . This time, it is a stuttering start which has undermined their progress. By mid-October they had already dropped 13 points. There was talk of Wenger not even seeing the season out, let alone extending his stay into next term and beyond. But is the long-serving Frenchman finally about to hit upon a team which, given the manner in which they\u2019re finishing this campaign, could well be installed as title favourites come August? Should Wenger strengthen in key areas then they would surely be vying for such status at the head of the market. He needs no more Mesut Ozils, no more Santi Cazorlas or Tomas Rosickys. Rather, he needs a new spine and characters with backbone. Mesut Ozil celebrates his goal on Saturday as the German World Cup winner continued his fine form . A central defender, central midfielder and centre forward need to arrive if this current vintage is to avoid going the same way as those who have promised so much yet delivered so little in recent years. Interestingly, Wenger\u2019s policy of chasing the best British talent could be on the way out. Yes, there was the capture of Danny Welbeck last summer, but that was more opportunistic than a long-term pursuit. Welbeck, in turn, has netted just four league goals and watched from the bench as Liverpool were torn apart. So, too, did Theo Walcott. He has the mitigation of injury, of course, but does Wenger trust him to remain fit for an entire campaign? Likewise, Jack Wilshere. Teams which win titles have players who, in short, play. Jack Wilshere (centre) watches on from the stands on Saturday after missing out through injury . Theo Walcott (left) has struggled since returning from a year-long injury lay-off . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey have both started just 17 of 31 league games. For the latter, a return of four goals is a sorry show given the 16 he plundered last season. So while there is the promise of better times ahead, issues remain for Wenger to sort. You feel he is finally on the cusp of something exciting at the Emirates. But then we have been there before and it ultimately ends in the celebration of failure. Wenger needs to think big this summer, or else goodwill from frustrated fans could be in short supply.", "candidate": "Arsenal beat Liverpool 3-0 in their Premier League clash on Saturday.

{"id": "3041e46bce555b63b6d3e463e5abe69789cf52ce-0", "article": "(CNN)In 1944, 16-year-old Yong Soo Lee of Taegu, Korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older Japanese man. The man took the two of them, and three other teenage girls, by train, then ship, to Taiwan. There, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five Japanese soldiers every day for a year. Lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with a venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts of food, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. Only the end of World War II brought her relief. Lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and other Asian nations, who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. These so-called \"comfort women\" suffered unimaginable physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a Joint Meeting of Congress on Wednesday, he has an opportunity to do right by these women, and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology -- something that carries the weight of his government. In 2007, in the very same chamber the prime minister will be issuing his address, the House of Representatives sent a profound message to the Japanese government by unanimously passing House Resolution 121, which I authored. The resolution called on the Japanese government to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery; publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the \"comfort women\" never occurred; and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime. We are still waiting for their government to comply. In 2006, during his first term, Prime Minister Abe unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of Japanese coercion and complicity in setting up and running the \"comfort women\" system. And during his second term, Abe and his right-wing allies have continued to question history -- even trying to dilute and rewrite it. Last year, I, along with 17 of my House colleagues, wrote to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, calling the timing and contents of the Japanese government report on the 1993 Kono statement: regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. Last year, meanwhile, the Abe administration tried (and failed) to get the United Nations to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report, which called on Japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery. Most notably, earlier this year, the Japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in U.S. history textbooks about the \"comfort women.\" Some say that Japan has already apologized enough and it's time to move on. To those people I say, in light of these continued attempts to rewrite history, for every step forward the Japanese government takes toward peace and reconciliation, it takes two steps back. As someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, I know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. In 1942, during World War II, my government put aside the constitutional rights of Japanese Americans and systematically incarcerated 120,000 of us. We were U.S. citizens, but merely because of our ancestry, the government treated us like the enemy. Decades later, we, the Japanese American community, fought for an apology from our government. In 1988, Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed into law, the Civil Liberties Act, which was a formal apology to United States citizens of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during World War II. Our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it, and healed many wounds as a result. Japan must now do the same. It must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for its mistake, and thereby gain the trust of her sister Asian nations. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Prime Minister Abe to face Japan's history. Germany knows something about this. After World War II, Germany engaged in a painful national \"coming to terms with the past\" that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. Time is of the essence. Today, there are fewer than 100 surviving \"comfort women\" across the Asia-Pacific. Each year, this number declines. Ms. Lee is one of 53 remaining Korean survivors. The survivors are dying by the day. They deserve the justice and apology that has been due to them for the past 70 years. The opportunity to speak to a joint meeting of Congress is an honor that is reserved for heads of state of our closest allies. I will be in the House chamber when Prime Minister Abe delivers his address. Ms. Lee will attend as my guest. Both of us hope the Prime Minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally, and firmly, apologize, and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly. Ms. Lee and her sisters deserve no less.", "candidate": "U.S. Rep.

And, it now appears the three-year-old cat belonging to Karl Lagerfeld is also the richest. The fashion designer has revealed his white Siamese earned \u00a32.18million last year - that's just\u00a3220,000 less than Cara Delevingne, one of the world's top models, who took home \u00a32.4million. Scroll down for video . Karl Lagerfeld, 82, with three-year-old Siamese Choupette, who has earned \u00a32million from TV appearances . Last year Choupette earned nearly as much as Cara Delevingne, despite only doing two jobs . And while Choupette raked in his cash by appearing in just two adverts, Cara had to work a lot harder, starring in multiple campaigns, walking tens of catwalks (including Lagerfeld's Chanel shows) and endorsing products. Lagerfeld, 82, said his cat was picked to appear in a commercial for cars in Germany and beauty products in Japan. And while he was happy for her to star in the adverts for the luxury items, he said she was 'too sophisticated' to be used to advertise food for other cats. 'Choupette became the most famous cat in the world, and the richest,' said Lagerfeld, the head designer for fashion house Chanel. 'She did two jobs and made three million euros last year. One was for cars in Germany and the other was for a Japanese beauty product. Choupette in her Corsa car adverts for the new range in 2014 in Berlin. The cat has her own Twitter account . 'I don't allow her to do foodstuffs and things like this. She's too sophisticated for that. She had something unique' Choupette, who has her own Twitter and Instagram accounts, appeared in an advert for Opel cars helping to promote the new Corsa range in 2014. She followed in the footsteps of supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell who previously helped promote the cars. The cat has even been a cover girl for a magazine and recently, while staying in New York, had her own \u00a3400 a night room at the Mercer hotel . Lagerfeld shot the adverts for the Japanese company She Uemura with his pet becoming the first cat to front a beauty campaign. The German-born designer raised eyebrows two years ago when he said he was so in love with his feline friend that he wanted to marry her. He revealed the glamour puss ate dinner with him at a table in the Paris mansion they shared and had weekly manicures for her claws. Lagerfeld doted on Choupette so much he described her as a 'kept woman'. His affection for his furry friend hasn't waned. 'She stays always with me and she has two personal maids, he said. 'They play with her, they have to take care of her beautiful white hair, the beauty treatments for her eyes, and they entertain her. She is the centre of the world.' While in New York recently to present his latest collection Choupette had her own room at the \u00a3400 a night Mercer hotel. Lagerfeld said he has become a recluse, rarely going out because he doesn't want to be photographed by other people and end up in their 'selfies'. His pet cat is his only companion. 'She is like a human being, but the good thing is that she's silent,' he told New York magazine. 'You don't have to discuss it. She hates other animals and she hates children. She stays always with me and she has two personal maids. 'They play with her, they have to take care of her beautiful white hair, the beauty treatments for her eyes, and they entertain her. She is the centre of the world. Karl Lagerfeld at the opening of the exhibition of his photos 'Corsa Karl and Choupette' at the Palazzo Italia . The 82-year-old fashion designer raised eyebrows recently when he said he was so in love with his feline friend he wanted to marry her. He also revealed that she has weekly manicures for her claws . 'If you saw her, you would understand. She is kind of Greta Garbo. There is something unforgettable about her, the way she moves, the way she plays. 'She's an inspiration for elegance. For attitude.' Asked if having Choupette had changed him, Lagerfeld said:'Maybe I became a better person perhaps, I don't know. 'Less selfish, I guess? I think it's grotesque, but what can you do? I believe in the unique. This is not just something to keep me company. It's only great because of the uniqueness of her.' And Lagerfeld's own life is as gilded and bizarre as his cats. He has a butler who wears a white coat and tie and travels ahead of him, greeting him with a chilled wine glass of Diet Coke. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar he once revealed that he has to sleep for seven hours a day, every day. Lagerfeld stands next to a drawing of his Birman cat at the vernissage for his photo calender 'Corsa Karl and Choupette' at the Palazzo Italia in Berlin . Choupette even has her own Instagram which posts adorable pictures of the cat . He follows a strict diet which starts with two protein shakes and steamed apples and he refuses to drink hot drinks. Lagerfeld famously lost six and a half stone saying that he did so so that he could, 'be a good clothes horse.' His hair, which he has pulled back into a pony-tail every day, is not actually the white hue it seems, in fact he has previously admitted that he sprays it every day with masses of dry shampoo to achieve the colour.

Last year for his SS15 Womenswear show Karl used his models to create a feminist protest . When he's not designing he spends much of his time flying around the world in private jets, accompanied by gorgeous male models. He creates his famous designs at home and says he rarely likes to go out because he hates people taking pictures of him. He told TheCut: 'I don\u2019t go to movie theaters because I don\u2019t want to be photographed by strangers. 'People bother me wherever I go. I like to imagine the world my way.

American Idol runner-up and congressional election runner-up Clay Aiken body-slammed Rep. Renee Ellmers on Monday's Howard Stern Show, calling her a 'b**ch' and an 'idiot' Ellmers, an intensive-care nurse by training, beat a seven-term incumbent in 2010 and won a third term by crushing Aiken in November . Ellmers, an intensive-care nurse who married a surgeon, plays an unwitting part in the show. 'She\u2019s an idiot,' said Aiken, 36. 'And I think her self-esteem is just in the floor. Under the floor.' The 51-year-old congresswoman captured 58.8 per cent of the vote on her way to a third term, compared with Aiken's 41.2 per cent. He won the Democratic primary when his chief rival, businessman Keith Crisco, died suddenly after a fall. Crisco was a former state secretary of commerce and a political veteran. Aiken is sketching out a second political life on the small screen, and lobbed some publicity for his show at Stern's gigantic audience \u2013 along with some slaps at Ellmers. 'You should see the second episode, because she\u2019s a bitch,' he said during the interview. A spokeswoman for Ellmers scoffed at Aiken, telling Daily Mail Online that his 'crude language and disrespectful demeanor towards the congresswoman has proven to the American people why he is a runner up.' Aiken doesn't much seem to care. He's already planning the third act in his political play, telling Stern that he's planning a future bid for elective office. MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH: Aiken conceded the race to Ellmers in November after she shellacked him by a nearly 18-point margin . 'Within the next decade I will [run] again,' he said. But 'not right now. Probably before six years.' Aiken, who is openly gay, also dove deep into his love life, telling Stern how hard he found it to date in New York City. He said he has stayed away from anonymous hookup apps like Grindr, insisting that he's 'not as much of a whore as people would like to think.' It seems Aiken picks his paramours from among men who friend him on Facebook. 'Here\u2019s the honest truth: When people friend me \u2013 God, I'm goign to admit this to people \u2013 when people friend me, if it\u2019s a guy who\u2019s really cute, I\u2019ll accept him,' he said. 'And then I\u2019ll look at the pictures.' Suddenly realizing that he had unleashed a flood of male admirers who might stalk him on social media, Aiken let out a shriek, and shouted: 'S**t!' Stern's producers wrote an editorial note on his website Monday afternoon, discouraging the practice. 'DO NOT send Clay a friend request now \u2013 after today's interview he is no longer accepting Facebook friend requests for dates!' the warning read. Howard Stern, a shock-jock radio host with a broad following, asked Aiken about his Esquire Network show and his taste in men . TWO-TIME LOSER: Aiken placed second to Ruben Studdard (right) in 2003 in the second season of the American Idol talent-search show . Aiken insisted that he's skilled at screening out people who are only interested in him for his fame. 'My bulls**t detector is pretty f**king good,' he claimed. He also complained about a former boyfriend, a law profesor, who left him high and dry. 'He was an Aires, and he's flightly. ... Gay men are flighty as hell,' Aiken said. 'Who the f**k breaks up with Clay Aiken?' The Hill was first to report Aiken's on-air swipe at Ellmers.", "candidate": "Clay Aiken, 36, lost to Rep.

{"id": "0d3f345c8561d1381a3680b8f434fdcc2fbb64af-2", "article": "Tim Sherwood said his Aston Villa team \u2018bamboozled\u2019 Liverpool and paid particular tribute to Christian Benteke, Fabian Delph and Jack Grealish, the teenager who shone on his Wembley debut. Villa earned a comeback win to book their place in the FA Cup final against Arsenal and end Steven Gerrard\u2019s dream of lifting the famous old trophy on his birthday before bidding farewell to the club. Sherwood was dealt a blow by Gabby Agbonlahor\u2019s failure to overcome a hamstring injury, but adapted his plans to brilliant effect as Liverpool struggled to cope with Villa\u2019s fluid attack. Christian Benteke is congratulated by Aston Villa team-mate Fabian Delph after scoring at Wembley . The Villa manager said: \u2018We changed the way we played. We normally go very direct, and use our pace down the sides, I think Liverpool would have expected us to do that. \u2018But we played it short through the thirds and caused some problems in the little pockets of areas. They were a little bit bamboozled to be honest. \u2018We needed to create a threat. I\u2019m not sure Liverpool tried to second-guess what we were going to do but I don\u2019t think they would have expected that.\u2019 \u2018We looked Liverpool and thought it might cause them a few problems if we played two No.10s with Jack Grealish and Charles N\u2019Zogbia and it turned out that way. They got them on the back foot. \u2018We needed to get players in support of Christian Benteke. I thought our game plan worked perfectly. We weren\u2019t worried about what Liverpool were going to do. We just knew if we played like we can we were going to cause them a lot of problems.\u2019 Brendan Rodgers conceded his side had been second best, but praised captain Gerrard, who had a late header cleared off the line. Aston Villa players chase Delph after the England midfielder made it 2-1 with 36 minutes left on the clock . \u2018He was doing everything, everything he possibly could to help the team,\u2019 said the Liverpool boss. \u2018I thought he was excellent. But collectively we didn't perform well enough to get a victory.\u2019 Sherwood kept faith with Grealish, the 19-year-old academy graduate, after handing him his first Premier League start against Queens Park Rangers a fortnight ago. He did not disappoint, playing a part in Benteke\u2019s equaliser, then setting up Delph\u2019s winner. \u2018The bigger the stage the better he plays, the more he relishes it,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018That\u2019s the sign of a good talent. Jack\u2019s someone I looked at before I was at the club and when I\u2019ve seen him in training, if you give him an instruction he sticks to the plan. He\u2019s got a big future at the football club.\u2019 Delph and team-mate Ashley Westwood celebrate their FA Cup win over Liverpool at Wembley . Grealish, who wears children\u2019s shinpads and socks rolled down, won two free-kicks for his team through dribbling with the ball. \u2018He\u2019s very durable,\u2019 added Sherwood. \u2018You should see the size of his legs, he\u2019s still a kid, he\u2019s still learning. He takes more kicks in training than he does on the pitch so he\u2019 s getting a lot of practice fending off those kicks \u2013 he probably needs bigger pads!\u2019 Benteke scored his ninth goal in seven games to level Philippe Countinho\u2019s opening goal, before Delph found the net for the second time under Sherwood, following his quarter-final goal against West Bromwich Albion. He failed to score under Paul Lambert this season. \u2018When I came to the club Fabian Delph had just signed a new contract, he had an opportunity to go to some of the teams in the top four. He showed a lot of loyalty to Aston Villa. I need characters like that, who put themselves on the line, show that spirit. Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho is mobbed by his team-mates after opening the scoring . \u2018I\u2019ve never seen him have a bad game here at Wembley for England and he\u2019s not had a bad one today, so hopefully he plays well in the final. \u2018He can add goals to his game, he has so much energy he can get into the final third and score. He\u2019s nicked a couple of goals for me already. I just want to encourage him to do that and then he\u2019ll be too expensive for anyone to buy!\u2019 On Benteke, Sherwood added: \u2018He\u2019s done that consistently for me. When I first come in I couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d only scored 12 goals with that strike force. I saw something wrong and viewed the tapes and saw they weren\u2019t getting the service.\u2019 Coutinho spreads his arms out wide after scoring during his side's surprise FA Cup defeat . Sherwood praised Villa\u2019s 32,000 fans and turned his attention to Arsenal. \u2018They were fantastic. It\u2019s easy to support your team when they\u2019re winning but even at 1-0 down I thought they were great and dragged the boys back. \u2018I watched the other semi-final yesterday and I saw how calm Arsene Wenger was after the game. But he probably realises there\u2019s nothing won. \u2018I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be Arsene Wenger after that final whistle, I was just delighted and I had to spill out them emotions. \u2018We\u2019ll be the underdogs, the pressure is on Arsenal, they\u2019re the holders and they\u2019ll want to win it again. We realise we\u2019ve got a lot of hard work between now and then to secure our Premier League safety and then come back here and take the game to Arsenal.\u2019 Benteke leaps in the air after levelling the scoreline \u00a0by hitting the back of the net in the 36th minute .", "candidate": "Aston Villa beat Liverpool 3-2 in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.

{"id": "5e2c79c2d54b0e6bc5d28545765bc9585d0c0224-2", "article": "(CNN)Giovanni Lo Porto put himself in harm's way to help, heading to Pakistan to work on a much needed reconstruction project following deadly flooding there. His work and his life, as he knew it then, came to a halt on January 19, 2012. That's when, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency, four armed men burst into the building where Lo Porto lived and abducted him along with colleague Bernd Muehlenbeck. Two years later, Lo Porto was dead -- killed accidentally by a U.S. drone strike, according to American authorities. The native of the Sicilian city of Palermo died along with a fellow al Qaeda hostage, American Warren Weinstein. That same counterterrorism operation in a border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan killed at least one al Qaeda leader, Ahmed Farouq, who was also a U.S. citizen. His family members, including his four brothers, called him Giancarlo. Lo Porto grew up in Sicily and then studied at London Metropolitan University, getting his undergraduate degree there in Peace and Conflict Studies in 2010, according to the school. A professor there remembers him as \"passionate, friendly (and) open-minded,\" according to an ANSA report. And the university, in a statement, described him as \"a popular student who was committed to helping others.\" \"We are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did,\" the school said. At the time he was taken captive, Lo Porto worked with the German aid organization Welthungerlife, a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide. Such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like Multan in Pakistan. That community was one of many in Pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010, which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead. These conditions are all too common in the South Asian nation, as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people, about a quarter of whom were children. \"He told me, 'I'm pleased to have returned to Asia and Pakistan, I love the people, culture and food in this part of the world,' \" said the London Metropolitan University professor. Specifically, Lo Porto was a project manager with Welthungerlife's clean water and sanitation program, working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in October 2011, according to Simone Pott, a spokeswoman for the aid group. Pott described Lo Porto as a lively, very positive man who made friends all over the world. Some of those friends in Italy, England and beyond pressed for Lo Porto's release after he was taken captive, urging Italy's government and newspaper editors to get his story out, ANSA reported. The same story said that al Qaeda (after first claiming he was being held) denied abducting Lo Porto, as did the Pakistani Taliban.

The burning ambition at Anfield is for Liverpool to be Champions League regulars with the potential to win the Barclays Premier League. But, after a wretched day against Aston Villa, they are clearly some way from realising that dream. Are Liverpool heading for mediocrity? Or is there sufficient talent to ensure the mistakes are corrected and progress can be resumed? A huge summer beckons and there is no margin for error. Philippe Coutinho opens the scoring for Liverpool against Aston Villa with a smart chipped finish at Wembley . Christian Benteke (centre) scores for Aston Villa to make it 1-1 and start Tim Sherwood's side's recovery . England midfielder Fabian Delph fires in Villa's second goal to win the game and book a place in the Cup final . For all the praise that came Brendan Rodgers\u2019 way last season, when he masterminded an unexpected and thrilling challenge for the title, the manager must accept criticism. Like his team, he has underperformed. Yes, he deserved credit for arresting a mid-winter slump. It was smart to change Liverpool\u2019s formation to 3-4-3, sparking an impressive 13-game unbeaten run in the league. But he has not made a mark on the games that matter. At Wembley we saw a prime example. He switched systems (from 3-4-2-1 to 4-3-3 to 4-1-4-1) but Liverpool never found a rhythm. This was not an isolated case. Changes had to be made after a poor start during the 1-1 draw with Basle that led to Liverpool\u2019s exit from the Champions League. There have been other issues. Picking an experimental line-up in the Bernabeu against Real Madrid last November was perplexing. He was outwitted by Louis van Gaal when Manchester United visited in March \u2014 it was a mistake not to start Steven Gerrard \u2014 and Mario Balotelli\u2019s signing has given Rodgers a problem that he has not been able to solve all season. Rodgers is innovative, thorough and, crucially, still learning his trade. His teams can have style and he has absolute faith in his ability. So, too, do Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool\u2019s owners. His future isn\u2019t even up for consideration. But that doesn\u2019t mean the pressure is off. Managing Liverpool comes with great expectation and Rodgers must provide the right answers come August. Then there are questions about the club\u2019s transfer committee. It grates at Anfield how much focus is put on the committee, which comprises Rodgers, chief executive Ian Ayre, Dave Fallows, the head of recruitment, chief scout Barry Hunter, Michael Edwards, the director of technical performance, and FSG investor Mike Gordon. Yet of the 17 players they have bought at considerable cost over the last two summers, only three \u2014 Simon Mignolet, Mamadou Sakho and Emre Can \u2014 could be said to have delivered. Tiago Ilori and Divock Origi, on loan at Bordeaux and Lille respectively, remain unknown quantities but many have been duds, such as Iago Aspas, Luis Alberto, Balotelli and Lazar Markovic. Others \u2014 Dejan Lovren and Adam Lallana \u2014 look overawed. This is another world to Southampton. Brendan Rodgers looks dejected as Liverpool crash out of the FA Cup after a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa . Liverpool manager Rodgers (far right) addresses his players during Sunday's game at Wembley Stadium . Wasting money in the market is not a new failing \u2014 Gerard Houllier, Rafa Benitez, Roy Hodgson and Kenny Dalglish made mistakes \u2014 but this is on a new level. If Rodgers is under pressure, then so are the men recommending players. FSG do not accept failure lightly. They have dispensed with two managers (Hodgson and Dalglish) and one director of football (Damien Comolli) since taking over in 2010 and will not hesitate to act if they feel things are going askew. Gerrard is going, Glen Johnson will follow, Brad Jones, Brad Smith, Jon Flanagan and Kolo Toure are out of contract. Fabio Borini has no Anfield future and nor does Balotelli. Rickie Lambert must leave to get regular football. Lucas Leiva may choose to pursue a new challenge. Raheem Sterling is at loggerheads with Liverpool over the new deal he has been offered. Jose Enrique, Martin Skrtel and Jordan Henderson have 12 months left on their contracts. Liverpool have agreed a new deal with Henderson but Skrtel is thinking about what he has been offered. Simon Mignolet is one of only three players signed over the last two years that have impressed this season . Emre Can\u00a0has played with a mature head that belies his tender years since joining from Bayer Leverkusen . Put all that together and it doesn\u2019t paint a settled picture. Rodgers did not want another window like last summer\u2019s, with a raft of new faces, but that looks unavoidable. Signing the right players is key but in the likely event of not being able to offer Champions League football, how easy will that be? Concluding deals has been a serious problem. In the past two years, Liverpool have tried to sign Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Diego Costa, Willian, Yevhen Konoplyanka and Alexis Sanchez without success. James Milner is on their radar, as is PSV Eindhoven\u2019s Memphis Depay, the 21-year-old Holland winger valued at \u00a325million. Sami Khedira\u2019s wages are out of Liverpool\u2019s range. They will also look to bring in a striker, but do clubs in upheaval make smooth progress? No. Absent at Wembley, just as he has been for much of the season, was Daniel Sturridge. It has been a wretched campaign for the England forward, one decimated by calf and thigh issues. Missing the semi-final will have done nothing to help his mental state. Without Luis Suarez, this should have been the year Sturridge took centre stage. Can he do it next season? He has the ability and goalscoring instinct but he will be no use to Rodgers if he is not fit for the major games. Mario Balotelli (centre) is one of a number of Liverpool signings that have failed to impress this season . Glen Johnson was sent on as a late sub for Joe Allen on Sunday is expected to leave the club this summer . Rodgers is keen for Milner, pictured in 2012, to help fill the void left by the outgoing Steven Gerrard . And finally there is the squad\u2019s spirit and attitude. Jamie Carragher has said one of the qualities of Liverpool\u2019s greatest sides was \u2018finding a way of winning\u2019 when the chips were down. That, however, was then, and now it is different. At Wembley, it was clear the travelling Kop doubted the character of this squad. Much focus has been put on Gerrard but it is risible to pin any blame on him for the defeat by Villa. He didn\u2019t have the swagger of youth but, even at 34, he still looked the one who would save Liverpool, with a late header that was cleared off the line and a pinpoint ball to Balotelli. He has set the example, so who will do it when he leaves? There is a flaw in Liverpool\u2019s mindset. Unless they toughen their resolve, they will continue to fall short. Rodgers has declared that losing can be a catalyst for success. In 12 months, he must hope his words are proven prophetic. Daniel Sturridge has spent much of the season watching from the stands due to a succession of injuries .

An early strike from Neymar and second-half brace from Luis Suarez sealed victory for Barcelona and placed the Catalan outfit into a commanding position ahead of the return at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. Blanc admitted his side felt the absence of the suspended Marco Verratti and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, while PSG were also unable to start with David Luiz and saw Thiago Silva hobble off in the early stages. Luis Suarez eases past David Luiz en route to scoring his second goal of the Champions League tie . Gerard Pique leads the celebrations after Barcelona secured a 3-1 victory in Paris on Wednesday night . 'I'm not going to make excuses about us being depleted,' said Blanc. 'I'm not doing that. We put a team out there, but we were dominated by Barcelona. 'It's only six days until the second leg, with a league game in between, so it's a 'short week' for people to recover. I think Barcelona were fitter than us. We had players who weren't at 100 per cent, and also a lot of absentees, but that should have been a motivation for us. We never controlled the ball well enough, and Barca were better than us in virtually every department. 'We will have the suspended players back next week, and that is an incentive. We'll try and put on a better show than we did tonight. They were better than us tonight and scored three goals. We'll try and show a different PSG at Barcelona next week.

Hamilton was absolved of any blame by both Wolff and Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, although the problem did at least provide another scenario from which to learn. Lewis Hamilton celebrates on the podium after winning the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday . Hamilton led home Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in Shanghai to retain his lead in the championship . With the next race in Bahrain following up swiftly on Sunday, Wolff said: 'We saw tensions between Nico and Lewis in the race and we tackled them directly on Sunday night to stop anything carrying over to this weekend. 'When you have intense competition it's normal it causes emotions to run high - and that's not something we want to change.

The flight data recorder, or \"black box,\" was found Thursday by recovery teams that have spent days since the March 24 crash scouring the mountainside in the French Alps where the plane went down. A statement from the BEA on Friday said its teams had immediately begun to investigate its contents. \"The initial readout shows that the pilot present in the cockpit used the autopilot to put the (airplane) into a descent towards an altitude of 100 (feet) then, on several occasions during the descent, the pilot modified the autopilot setting to increase the speed of the (airplane) in descent,\" it said. \"Work is continuing to establish the precise history of the flight.\" Evidence from the plane's cockpit voice recorder, recovered swiftly after the crash, had already led investigators to believe that Lubitz acted deliberately to bring down the plane, killing all 150 people on board. And prosecutors in Germany said Thursday that an analysis of a tablet device retrieved from the 27-year-old's apartment in Dusseldorf revealed that he had researched suicide methods and cockpit door security on the Internet. The correspondence and search history on the device demonstrated that the co-pilot used it from March 16 to March 23, Dusseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said. The search history was not deleted and also revealed searches concerning medical treatment, the prosecutor said. Investigators have focused on Lubitz's health as they try to establish his motivation. But the missing \"black box\" was expected to yield important evidence about the plane's final minutes. A female police officer digging by hand for clothes in a ravine that been searched previously found the flight data recorder Thursday afternoon about 8 inches (20 centimeters) below the surface, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told reporters. Usually white with florescent orange, this discovered recorder lived up to its name as a black box because fire had darkened it with ashes. In addition, out of more than 2,000 DNA samples collected from the crash site, lab workers have isolated 150 DNA profiles, Robin told reporters. \"That does not mean we've identified\" the crash's 150 victims, Robin said -- noting the recovered DNA still must be compared with DNA submitted by the families of those who died in the crash. Authorities have also found 470 personal effects at the site, according to Robin. That number includes 40 cell phones, though all those were badly damaged. Robin cast doubt that any useful information could be retrieved from those phones, given their condition. That view is consistent with French officials' claims Wednesday insisting that two publications, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, were wrong to report that cell phone video showed the harrowing final seconds from on board the flight. Noting he's made a criminal request to German authorities but is for now conducting his own investigation, the French prosecutor said he is tasked with an involuntary homicide investigation. But Robin noted that Lubitz made voluntary actions -- such as guiding the plane toward the mountain and reducing its speed to prevent alarms from going off -- and was \"alive and conscious\" to the very end. A European official government official with detailed knowledge of the investigation said that Lubitz's actions amount to \"premeditated murder.\" While cautioning that there are still many holes in understanding Lubitz's motivation, the disclosures about his Internet searches show that he planned to do what he was going to do, according to this official. Calls for crash avoidance technology . It is becoming increasingly clear to investigators that Lubitz was \"very afraid\" he would lose his license to fly because of his medical issues, a law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Thursday. It's already emerged that Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Flight 9525 and that he had concealed from his employer recent medical leave notes saying he was unfit for work. But the law enforcement source said that after a severe depressive episode in 2009, Lubitz relapsed with severe depression and stress in late 2014. In the weeks leading up to the crash, Lubitz was shopping doctors, seeing at least five, perhaps as many as six, the source said, as he kept going from one doctor to the next seeking help, including from a sleep specialist. He was prescribed powerful medication, though it's not clear he was taking it. Opinion: What if my patient is a pilot?

Sportsmail was at the Academy Stadium to see how the youngsters got on... Tammy Abraham smashes Chelsea into the lead with a fierce drive into the top corner . Manchester City (4-2-3-1) Kjetil Haug: Norwegian international has been on the bench for long periods but got the nod and looked shaky under the high ball. That said, powerless to stop Abraham's volleys and Soalnke's killer. 6.5 . Pablo Maffeo: Barcelona-born former Espanyol youngster is not the tallest and at times struggled with Chelsea's diagonals early on but grew into the game and could have levelled. 6.5 . Tosin Adarabioyo: Manchester lad and England youth international, City's captain was a commanding presence at the heart of defence. Has the movement of Yaya Toure but put a big shift in. 7 . Christian Haug goes up for the ball under pressure from Chelsea forwards during the Youth Cup final . Cameron Humphreys-Grant: Has captained England and, like Adarabioyo had his hands full against a vibrant Chelsea attack but stood up to the test well. 6.5 . Jose Angelino Tasende: Spanish left-back is not the tallest and was not able to drive forward as much as he would have liked against strong opposition. 6 . Kean Bryan: Box-to-box midfielder from Beswick, yards away from the Etihad Stadium, pulled up injured after 36 minutes but battled back bravely but missed a glorious chance to tie things up. 6.5 . Manchester City midfielder Kean Bryan tracks the run of Dominic Solanke as City looked to stem the tide . Aaron Nemane: Moved to Manchester from France as a toddler, the wide man who scored twice in the first leg of the Semi Final did outwitted Dasilva with a delightful tap and go but could not find the final, killer ball. Blasted wide when should have levelled. 6.5 . Bersant Celina: Kosovan international Celina struggled to fill in for injured star Thierry Ambrose, seeing one shot from the edge of the area easily held by Collins. 6 . Manu Garcia: Joined City from Sporting Gijon and the mini David Silva showed some neat touches on the rare occasions he found space. Was largely ineffective and should have done better when teed up by Barker late on. Yanked on 85 minuted. 6 . Manuel Garcia gets a shot away, but it was blocked by Jake Clarke-Salter . Isaac Buckley-Ricketts: Pacy Mancunian centre forward produced measured finish to bring City level but was marshalled well for the majority of the evening. 7 . Brandon Barker: City's star man, the two-footed local lad is tipped for big things at the Etihad but was perhaps guilty of trying to do too much at times here. Did create a fine chance for Garcia with a trademark surge and almost levelled late on. 7.5 . City's players celebrate after Isaac Buckley (left) had levelled the game in the first half . Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Bradley Collins: The Southampton-born stopper could do little about City's opener and distributed the ball well. 6.5 . Fikayo Tomori: Canadian born but eligible for England combined well with Clarke-Salter to nullify City's threat in a commanding-looking partnership. 7 . Ola Aina: England Under-19 right-back found space time and time again down the right. Quick, strong and often influential. 7 . Jake Clarke-Salter: England Under 18s international often too strong for Buckley-Ricketts and, on the evidence of this sterling performance, is one to watch. 7 . Jay Dasilva: Under-21 regular is still 16. Fortunate to escape at least a caution with a from-behind challenge in the first half but was solid at the back and lively going forward, whipping in a number of decent crosses. 7 . Ruben Sammut: Scottish youth international covered his back four expertly and kickstarted a number of breaks as City pressed. 6.5 . Ruben Sammut plays the ball out in an excellent performance protecting the back four . Tammy Abraham: Two volleys for his 35th and 36th strikes of the season. Big, bold and often brilliant, Chelsea will be hoping the injury that saw him substituted on 67 minutes is not serious. 8 . Charlie Colkett: Put in a captain's shift in the centre of the park as the visitors won the midfield battle. Is tipped for big things and showed just why. 7.5 . Abraham makes it 2-1 at the Academy Stadium with an acrobatic finish past\u00a0Christian Haug . Dominic Solanke: Scored for England in the European Under-17 Championship Final and put in a powerful shift here, teaming up well with Abraham before effectively killing the tie with a neat third. 7.5 . Charly Musonda: The Belgian playmaker, the only overseas man in the starting XI, was quiet by his standards and drilled a decent chance tamely wide. Departed late on. 6 . Isaiah Brown: Said to be interesting Jose Mourinho but will not want to dwell on his big moment early on when he blasted over bar when unmarked on the edge of the box. Miss aside, was a constant menace. Substitutes: . Kasey Palmer (Abraham, 67, 6): On for Abraham and showed explosive pace straight away but was let down by a hurried attempt at a finish which flew over the bar.

Leonardo Ulloa was not supposed to be starting this match, left out in favour of Andrej Kramaric. But when David Nugent suffered injury in the warm-up, Ulloa was sent on. Inside 15 minutes he scored a goal that provided the platform for a victory that looks increasingly like being part of a truly great escape. That familiar melody was hummed loudly by Leicester's fans at full-time, fuelled by Andy King's late second goal and the sight of their team moving off the bottom of the table for the first time since November.

Booked: Amat, Shelvey . Manager: Garry Monk 6 . Referee: Lee Probert . Attendance: 31,121 . Man of the Match: Esteban Cambiasso . Leonardo Ulloa gives Leicester the lead, scoring from Wes Morgan's knock down . One more goal would have taken them out of the relegation places instead of Hull, but much more like this and that will come. This is three Premier League wins in a row for the first time since 2000. Manager Nigel Pearson has been here before. Leicester emerged for this game looking like, one imagines, the pack of dogs that Pearson once fought off with a stick while hiking in the Carpathian mountains. His side are finally bearing teeth at the end of an arduous season, two wins in succession providing genuine hope of a remarkable surge to safety. Shifting off the bottom for the first time since November was the carrot for this game should defeat be avoided. Pearson selected an attacking side, a 3-4-1-2 with genuine wingers in the wide roles. He sent on Ulloa for the injured Nugent and played Andrej Kramaric as No 10. Cambiasso (front) stretches to control the ball ahead of the oncoming Swansea forward\u00a0Ki Sung-yueng (behind) at the King Power Stadium . Leicester hitman Leonoardo Ulloa (right) strikes the ball to score his side's opening goal against Swansea during the match on Saturday . The home side began with feral ferocity. Straight from kick-off Jamie Vardy drove at the Swansea defence only being halted at the last by Federico Fernandez. The tone was set. The lead Leicester craved was theirs in the 15th minute. Ulloa made the Premier League sit up and take notice at the start of the season with a flurry of goals, but his failure to maintain the momentum contributed largely to Leicester's decline. This was his first Premier League goal in four months, but what an important one. Following a corner the ball was recycled to Marcin Wasilewski, who launched a long ball from halfway that Ulloa flicked-on to Wes Morgan, who had stayed up. The centre-back fed it back to the Argentine who lashed home under the diving leg of Ashley Williams. The King Power Stadium erupted, and Ulloa ran to the dugout to Jon Sanders, the club's player liaison officer, and share a hug. Leicester are very much together at the crucial stage of the season, as this performance illustrated. Swansea were nothing like their fluid best, restricted to long shots easily held by Kasper Schmeichel. At half-time Wasilewski was forced off, with Richie De Laet coming on, and Leicester switched to four at the back. Their energy remained. Three minutes after the break Marc Albrighton fired a shot narrowly wide, and shortly after Kramaric sent a chance over following a breakaway. Schmeichel saved well from Jonjo Shelvey, was again from range, but it was Leicester unpicking Swansea's defence with greater frequency. In the 55th minute Vardy crossed to Ulloa, who sent his header onto the roof of the net while back-peddling. A minute later, Ulloa got free down right and centred, Vardy miscued and Kramaric ballooned a very good opening over. This has been a theme of Leicester's season, always positive but too often missing chances. It has previously proved costly. It would have done again in the 67th minute, but for a stunning save by Schmeichel. Nelson Oliveira ran clear and stayed on his feet when Robert Huth made a desperate lunge \u2013 referee Lee Probert could have awarded a penalty and possibly red in any case. Schmeichel came out in star jump fashion \u2013 like his dad Peter \u2013 and thwarted Oliveira's finish. Ulloa rushes over to supporters to celebrate a crucial goal in the club's bid to avoid relegation from the Premier League this season .

Schmeichel grasped the ball and blew out his cheeks moments later after saving another snap shot from Shelvey. Jefferson Montero than saw his shot deflect wide off Morgan when it could have gone anywhere. From then the game was Leicester's. Through Vardy, Albrighton and substitute Riyad Mahrez they possessed pace to counter at speed Swansea struggled to handle. In the 73rd minute Vardy led a two-on-one breakaway but over-hit his pass to Mahrez allowing Lukasz Fabianski time to dive and block. Vardy was again clear six minutes later through Danny Drinkwater's pass and fell under contact from Ashley Williams as he pushed the ball past the Swansea captain. Pearson was incensed but it would have been soft. Vardy sent another chance over, and Fabianski palmed wide a stinging shot by Mahrez. But a minute from time Leicester did seal the win. Esteban Cambiasso, superb all afternoon, fired a free-kick through Swansea's wall, Fabianski spilled the ball, and King applied the required tap-in. The noise was phenomenal. Leicester believe.

Beto had looked to have cost his side their progress, with the game heading towards extra time, before substitute Gameiro arrived to slot home with five minutes remaining. It had been a risk to start the Portuguese keeper, but Sevilla boss Unai Emery decided it one he was prepared to take, despite Beto's absence since a game against Real Madrid in the first week of February. Carlos Bacca slams home the early penalty after Vitolo had been brought down by Neto after five minute . Hulk celebrates his goal with Axel Witsel but Zenit couldn't hold on for extra time in the end . It was a gamble that spectacularly back-fired, with the keeper gifting Zenit two of the softest goals imaginable, to see the holders surrender a two-goal lead in the tie. First, just a matter of seconds after the half-time break, with Sevilla two goals up on aggregate a cruising, Beto dropped the ball, under no pressure, at the feet of Salomon Rondon, allowing the Venezuelan to rekindle the tie from a matter of yards. Then, when Brazilian forward Hulk hit a speculative, but not overly threatening shot from 40 yards, Beto could only flap it over his own line, turning the tie on its head and sending it towards extra time. But as Zenit looked to apply the pressure, and Beto attempted to atone himself with two stunning saves, one from each of the two goalscorers, the champions struck on the break. Bacca is mobbed by his Sevilla team-mates after putting them in complete control of the tie early on . Zenit:\u00a0Lodygin, Criscito, Neto, Lombaerts, Smolnikov; Garcia, Witsel; Danny, Shatov, Hulk, Rondon (Kerzhakov 83 mins) Subs not used: Malafeev, Rodic, Anyukov, Tymoshchuk, Sheydaev, Arshavin . Goal: Rondon 48, Hulk 72 . Booked: Neto, Witsel, Lodygin . Sevilla: Beto, Tremoulinas, Pareja (Iborra 22), Coke, Carrico, Vidal, Vitolo (Suarez 92), Banega, Mbia, Krychowiak, Bacca (Gameiro 72) Subs not used:\u00a0Rico, Figueiras, Navarro, Reyes . Goal: Bacca 6, Gameiro 85 . Booked: Iborra . It was a pulsating finish to a game that had started promisingly, but looked to have faded away somewhat in the first half. The Spanish side carried a slim lead, given them by a stunning Denis Suarez volley at the end of the first leg, into the second game, but Zenit were optimistic after scoring an away goal in Seville, which gave them a perceived edge. That advantage lasted little more than five minutes however, as defender Neto stupidly dived in on Sevilla winger Vitolo, to concede an early penalty. It was a bizarre challenge to make, with Vitolo running towards the byline, and the ball not even close to within winning distance. The contact may have been minimal, but the fact that it was there at all was as much down to Neto's stupidity as anything else, and it was hard to feel sympathy for the Portuguese defender. Carlos Bacca was not in the mood to show any mercy, dispatching the spot-kick beautifully, high into the top corner, and the visitors were in complete control. From then the pattern of play was set, with Sevilla inviting pressure, absorbing it, and hitting Zenit on the break. Indeed, the visitors, two goals ahead on aggregate and with the majority of the game in their own half, had much the better chances in the first period. Coke tries to get a shot away as Sevilla threatened on the break, before Zenit hit back in the second half . Zenit midfielder Axel Witsel challenges Sevilla's Benoit Tremoulinas during a tense first half . Aleix Vidal should have put them further in front, after out-pacing former Manchester City midfielder Javi Garcia, but he seemed to forget that running is not enough, failing to either pass or shoot and simply running into Yuri Lodygin. Soon after Bacca sprang the offside trap and rounded the Zenit keeper, only to see his shot cleared off the line by Igor Smolnikov. Andre Villas-Boas' team barely registered a shot before first-half stoppage time, the one exception coming in the 18th minute, when captain Danny exchanged passes with Hulk before seeing his near-post shot saved by Beto. But, as the first 45 approached its conclusion, the hosts suddenly produced a succession of chances, and could easily have got themselves back into the tie. Salomon Rondon, whose goal got Zenit back in the tie, was starved of service for long periods of the game . First Salomon Rondon, almost entirely ineffectual up front in the opening period, was gifted the ball three yards from goal following some dubious defending at a set piece, but the Venezuelan striker couldn't sort his feet out, and stumbled the ball away from target. Moments later Danny struck the base of the post with a vicious effort that suggested Zenit might have more to offer in the final quarter of the tie. Not that they could have expected the sort of favours that Beto handed them in the second period, and which looked to have at least earned them an extra 30 minutes. In the end though, it was the home side's defending that let them down, failing to keep the back door shut as they pushed for a winner, allowing Gameiro to do the damage.", "candidate": "Carlos Bacca gave Sevilla the lead from the penalty spot after five minutes.

There was a frantic sense of do or die in the closing stages at the King Power stadium. Pearson and his players surely knew anything less than three points against West Ham, a side who have not won away from home since December 2nd, would see them doomed to relegation. At the final whistle, the players went to all four corners of the stadium to applaud their fans. Just four points behind Sunderland with six of their eight remaining games to be played at home, it is very much game on for Foxes. Andy King was the hero as Premier League strugglers Leicester City struck late to earn a vital three points against West Ham United . Leicester City hero King is joined by veteran striker David Nugent following the Welsh midfielder's late winner against West Ham United . Seasoned professional Nugent had the chance to all but secure Leicester City victory but the striker missed from the spot . Nugent saw his penalty kick thwarted by West Ham United's Spanish goalkeeper Adrian during the Premier League clash at the King Power . It was eyeballs out, quickfire action from the 80th minute. The Hammers had a flurry of chances with Schmeichel forced into two good saves and at the other end Aaron Cresswell made a miraculous block on the line to deny a Andrej Kramaric effort. But substitute Kramaric supplied Jamie Vardy whose scuffed shot was tapped in by King from two yards out.

Cambiasso celebrates after scoring to make it 1-0 during the Premier League match between Leicester City and West Ham United . West Ham have had their Premier League survival all but assured since before Christmas and it appears even securing a finish outside of the Premier League\u2019s bottom six for a third successive season \u2013 a feat not achieved since the last century \u2013 cannot win Allardyce a new contract. Meanwhile nobody realistically expected Leicester to escape their current predicament at the foot of the Barclay\u2019s Premier League and seven points from safety before this game. If they do it will represent a remarkable turnaround in results. The message pre-match from Pearson and midfielder Jamie Vardy was that if they could recapture the spirit they showed in a 4-3 defeat against Leicester a fortnight ago they would overcome the Hammers. In starting the consistently lively Riyad Mahrez, an attacking intent was demonstrated and the home side were lively from the start. James Collins, the 31-year-old Welshman, made several important clearances in the first ten minutes for West Ham and the travelling fans responded with a chorus of \u2018he\u2019s the ginger Pele.\u2019 But it was as he retreated to goal that the ball ricocheted off his back and into the path of Esteban Cambiasso who cooly put Leicester ahead after 12 minutes. The ball bounced kindly for the Argentinian whose sublime right footed strike just outside the D sailed in. As his teammates rushed to celebrate, he showed a wise head by urging them to get back into position. Cambiasso slides to his knees as he celebrates in front of the Leicester City fans following his opener for the relegation threatened Foxes . Leonardo Ulloa  draws a foul from Carl Jenkinson  during the Barclays Premier league match Leicester City and West Ham United . Moments later referee Mark Clattenburg made the right decision to award the home side a penalty after Carl Jenkinson brought down Leonardo Ulloa. But David Nugent's effort from the spot was woeful, low, right down the middle and easily saved by Adrian. They were left to rue the missed opportunity when the Hammers pulled one back in the 32nd minute. Alex Song sent a floating ball into he box which soared over the head Jeffrey Schupp and was controlled by Cheikou Kouyate, the Senegalese firing low and powerfully into the bottom left corner past a helpless Kasper Schmeichel. Kouyate was close to doubling his goal tally in the 73rd minute, his shot from Sakho\u2019s lay off hitting the post. Meanwhile Vardy had two good chances in as many minutes. In a thrilling display of end-to-end action both sides demonstrated the best of their attacking wares and some rather poor defending too but ultimately Leicester deserved to come out on top.

The horrific incident happened after Lisa and James Tuttle moved with their five children to the rural village of Geldeston in Norfolk in 2005. They thought their big house with a large garden surrounded by arable land would be a peaceful and idyllic family home. But their happiness was shattered in 2014 after their dogs Marley and Lily were shot after escaping on to their neighbour's farmland where they were accused of killing his birds. Scroll down for video . Lisa Tuttle with her one remaining dog Bella, after her other two dogs were shot dead by the farmer next door . Lily, centre, and Marley, right, were killed as they were accused of slaughtering a farmer's birds after escaping onto his land from the Tuttle's garden. Bella, left, is the family's remaining dog . Lisa reveals on Channel 5 show The Nightmare Neighbour Next Door how she had a long-running dispute with the owner of the farm, John Cook, over her dogs trespassing on his property. It began with their first dog - a Labrador called Ruby - who the family got shortly after moving into their new home. Lisa said Ruby kept escaping from their garden onto Mr Cook's land causing him to come and complain. She explained: 'He knocked on the door and said \"your dog is getting out, she's being a problem, she's going after my pheasants\".' 'I didn't like him, I thought he was rude. I was upset as I didn't want to cause trouble. We did our best to make sure it wouldn't happen again and I thought that would be the end of it.' But a few days later, Mr Cook returned to complain that Ruby had killed 120 of his birds and if he saw her on his land again, he would shoot her. James said he found this hard to believe as Ruby did not show any evidence of having attacked the birds as she never had blood on her fur or around her mouth. Lisa outside her home in\u00a0Geldeston, Norfolk. She thought it would be the perfect place to raise her family but now wants to move following the devastating loss of their two family pets . Lisa added: 'She was gentle. I found it so hard to believe what he was saying was true. I said I wanted proof of dead pheasants before I gave him any money but we didn't hear from him again.' Terrified that Ruby's life was at risk if she escaped from their garden again, Lisa and James made the painful decision to have her re-homed. 'Ruby's safety came first so we have to give her away, it tore me apart for three or four months,' Lisa said. Her young son Ryan added he was also upset they had to give her away. 'Ruby was a really gentle dog, I loved her but she kept escaping. I was devastated, heartbroken, I had her for a long time,' he said. The family decided to keep one of Ruby's puppies, Marley, and hoped she would not have her mother's adventurous tendency to roam outside their garden. For years, they didn't have any trouble with Mr Cook so they decided to get two more dogs, Lily and Bella in 2013. But the three dogs started following in Ruby's footsteps and repeatedly escaped onto Mr Cook's land. The Tuttle's first dog Ruby, pictured, had to be re-homed because she kept escaping from their garden . Ryan said they tried to put up more fences and block holes to stop the dogs leaving their garden 'but they kept digging under the hedge and getting out.' However, as they had no further complaints from their neighbours, Lisa didn't think too much of it. In August 2014, they arranged to go away for a family holiday leaving her mother and sister to look after the three dogs. Three days into their trip, they received some shocking news. 'My mum called and said the farmer had complained that Lily and Marley had been on his land,' Lisa recalled. 'It was a shock as I hadn't had any runs in with him since Ruby. 'She said they had both been shot, they're dead. It was like a dream, I was devastated.' Mr Cook said the dogs had broken into one of his pens and slaughtered his birds. This gave his gamekeeper the right to shot them under the Protection of Livestock Act. Owners whose dogs are killed can prosecute on the grounds that their property has been destroyed. Lisa reveals how they tried to patch up holes in their garden walls and fences to stop the dogs getting out but they kept digging holes to escape . Marley, pictured, was killed for worrying livestock after the farmer's gamekeeper acted within the law when the dogs were said to break into a bird pen on farmer John Cook's property . But if the killer has a 'lawful excuse' - such as\u00a0where there were no other means of ending or preventing the dogs worrying their livestock - they have not committed an offence. Mr Cook says he and his gamekeeper acted with the law and they have not been charged with any wrong-doing. It's a bitter pill for the Tuttles to swallow as they say they are bereft at the loss of their two pets. Ryan said when he heard the dogs had been killed he felt like 'a chunk of me was gone, it was like my heart was pulled away.' Meanwhile, Lisa, who still has one dog, Bella, says she is also struggling to come to terms with what happened and no longer wants to live in the area. She said: 'I'm on anti-depressants. I don't want to live here anymore. Everywhere there are reminders of what he's done and what he's taken away from us.'

Mourinho was having no truck with the Barclays Premier League's Fair Play table, which lauded the Hammers for their attacking style and frowned upon Chelsea's lack of respect. He dismissed it as a joke. He was relaxed ahead of a visit from Manchester United. He even offered support to Manuel Pellegrini, claiming the Manchester City boss had been treated like a 'criminal' after losing six of eight games. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has spoken out in defence of under pressure colleague Manuel Pellegrini .

United defender Chris Smalling scores his side's fourth goal as they beat City 4-2 at Old Trafford last week . Pellegrini poses with Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany (left) after winning the league last season . No love is lost between Mourinho and Pellegrini, but the Chelsea manager said: 'I'm surprised a team that won two titles in three years and are still champions can be brought to hell. 'It looks like they don't deserve respect, that they are bad players, that the manager is a bad manager, that they are a disaster. But they are the champions. 'You want lots of teams fighting for the title. 'So how can you be so negative with a team that's won two titles in three years? Some managers cannot win and life goes on, but the guys at Man City... it looks like they're criminals.' Victory on Saturday will extend Chelsea's lead over United to 11 points and inch Mourinho closer to his first Premier League title since 2006, having led from the start. 'We are boring, top of the league since day one,' said the Portuguese. 'Everyone would love the Premier League to be like the Championship, with four teams separated by a couple of points. 'I know this would be the ideal scenario, but since day one we are there. We are trying not to allow that to happen. We have big determination to be champions.' As for the Fair Play table, well, he couldn't care less. It is compiled using data from Premier League delegates who mark teams in six categories. The conduct of Chelsea's players towards match officials is rated the worst in the league and only Sunderland score worse when it comes to the behaviour of staff. 'I'm not surprised,' chuckled Mourinho. 'These delegates are the same delegates who do the evaluation of the referees' performances and I read them every week. 'I think it depends on the food and drink. We have to change the catering because we have the best and many times they don't see the games. Next season, bread and water.'

Giroud netted five times in Arsenal's four consecutive league wins last month as Arsene Wenger's side took all 12 points on offer to claim the award for March. And in doing so he joined a long list of his compatriots to be ranked as a month's best player in the English top flight, alongside the likes of Thierry Henry, Eric Cantona and Nicolas Anelka. Olivier Giroud won the Barclays Premier League player of the month award for March after his run of form . Thierry Henry collects the award for April before a match at Highbury in May 2000, one of four wins for him . David Ginola was the first French winner of the award, claiming it while at Newcastle in August 1995 . August 1995: David Ginola, Newcastle . March 1996: Eric Cantona, Manchester United . April 1998: Emmanuel Petit, Arsenal . December 1998: David Ginola, Tottenham . February 1999: Nicolas Anelka, Arsenal . April 2000: Thierry Henry, Arsenal . August 2001: Louis Saha, Fulham . August 2002: Sylvain Wiltord, Arsenal . September 2002: Thierry Henry, Arsenal . February 2003: Robert Pires, Arsenal . January 2004: Thierry Henry, Arsenal . April 2004: Thierry Henry, Arsenal . November 2008: Nicolas Anelka, Chelsea . March 2010: Florent Malouda, Chelsea . December 2010: Samir Nasri, Arsenal . March 2015: Olivier Giroud, Arsenal . Giroud's prize sees his country edge out Holland as the most successful nation in terms of player of the month awards, beaten only by the native English on home territory. Much of that success comes down to Giroud's club, Arsenal. They have provided 10 French winners with Henry, Anelka, Emmanuel Petit, Sylvain Wiltord, Robert Pires and Samir Nasri have all won it while in north London. Former Arsenal striker Henry is the top Frenchman was four awards, trailing only Steven Gerrard (on six), Wayne Rooney and Alan Shearer (both five), and sitting in good company, level with Cristiano Ronaldo, Dennis Bergkamp, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes. 'I'm really pleased with it,' Giroud told Arsenal's official website after winning the March prize. 'I would like to thank my team-mates and of course the fans, because it's a collective sport and I couldn't do it on my own. 'It's a great honour to have been selected as Player of the Month, especially because we wanted to bounce back from the Champions League disappointment. Manchester United's French forward Eric Cantona was named player of the month in March 1996 . Emmanuel Petit is pictured with another Frenchman, Arsene Wenger. He won the award in April 1998 . Nicolas Anelka won the award twice: with Arsenal in February 1999 and then with Chelsea in 2008 . Louis Saha's performances for Fulham saw him crowned as the month's best player in August 2001 . England - 88 . France - 16 . Holland - 15 . Spain - 8 . Republic of Ireland, Wales - 6 . Portugal - 5 . Argentina, Nigeria - 4 . Brazil, Italy, Scotland, Trinidad and Tobago - 3 . Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, Ghana, Russia, Senegal, Sweden, Uruguay - 2 . Australia, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Costa Rica, Croatia, Germany, Iceland, Jamaica, Paraguay, Serbia, Turkey - 1 . 'That's what we've done and we've come back really strongly. We all want to finish strongly and this award will give me more confidence for the following games.' Giroud averaged a goal every 72 minutes throughout March, and his excellent levels of performance are no change for the French on English shores. Aside from the Arsenal contributions,  Ginola, Louis Saha, Anelka (for Chelsea) and Florent Malouda have all been named as the player of the month at some point during their spells in England. Spanish, Irish, Welsh, Portuguese, Argentine and Nigerian players have all done well too, but every country aside from England and Holland have, at most, half the number France have. And to make the point of their dominance even more, look to European rivals Germany. They have had just one winner, the first: Jurgen Klinsmann in 1994. Sylvain Wiltord's early season form saw him claim the player of the month prize in August 2002 for Arsenal . Another Frenchman playing for Arsenal, Robert Pires, was a winner in February 2003 at Highbury . Florent Malouda was the second of two French winners coming from Chelsea when he won in March 2010 .

As of Tuesday night, the most pertinent one available to him is 115. That is the number of goals Guardiola's Bayern team have scored so far this season, a number plenty enough to take them in to the last four of the Champions League, the semi-final of the German Cup and to the cusp of successive Bundesliga titles. It's a funny game, football isn't it? People can grow restless, unhappy even, pretty quickly.

Referee: Martin Atkinson (England) 8 . Attendance: 70,000 . Well, despite the horrors of the 3-1 first leg defeat in Portugal last week, that remains very much on and the statistics show that Guardiola and his players have indulged in a fair amount of self-expression along the way. Guardiola won't remember all the season's goals. He won't remember all of the seven Bayern scored against Roma and against Shakhtar, the eight they plundered at home to Hamburg or the six they put past SC Paderborn. The Spaniard will remember the half dozen his team scored here on Tuesday night, though. He will remember them - especially the five that came in a brutal, spellbinding opening half - because they will be set against the background of last week's defeat and the disgruntlement that followed. Questions were asked about his own future, Bayern's club doctor walked out, slamming the door behind him. By half-time, though, those matters seemed rather distant already and that is what brilliant football does. It makes people forget the small details. That, in a way, is the whole point of sport. Certain Bayern's rather entitled supporters will have seen little better than this over the years. Not just because of the quality of the football but because of the context and because of the sheer hunger and monotonous forward drive of this team. 'I knew my players could do this,' said Guardiola afterwards. 'But this was not perfect. We can still improve.' Having started so badly in the first leg last week \u2013 Bayern were two down early\u2013 they needed to reverse things quickly. After 23 minutes they were two goals up and, from that point on, the contest was no longer valid. Lewandowski had already struck the post when Bayern took the lead, left-back Juan Bernat crossing to the near post for Thiago Alcantara to thump in a header. The goal served to break the tension a little and as Porto failed to settle, Bayern began a hypnotic and relentless journey through the gears. A shot from Thomas Muller was saved by Fabiano soon after but that proved a rare moment of competence for the Porto goalkeeper. He had a poor night and was beaten for the second time midway through the half when Jerome Boateng glanced a header in by the post after a corner. At this point, Bayern were already mathematically through. Porto needed to score to maintain an interest but they were too skittish, too panicked and too intent in arguing with referee Martin Atkinson to ever get a foothold in a game that quickly galloped away from them. Bayern Munich celebrate in front of their delighted fans after overturning a first leg deficit to reach the Champions League semi-finals .

Porto defender Diego Reyes slides in to a challenge to dispossess Bayern Munich frontman Mario Gotze during the first half .

The third goal arrived soon after \u2013 Lewandowski finishing first time after Philipp Lahm had set him up beautifully \u2013 and it was at this point a massacre seemed in the offing. A drive from Muller from distance then struck defender Casemiro and span through Fabiano's flapping legs in the 36th minute and, after a rare Porto attack culminated in a dive by, and a booking for, Jackson Martinez, Lewandowski struck again, teasing two defenders before arrowing a perfect shot in to the corner with his right foot. Half-time found the Portuguese on their knees and they crawled to the dressing room. Beyond that, Bayern lost some momentum and Porto even scored a goal, Martinez heading in. On the touchline, however, Guardiola's greatest inconvenience was a split to the seam of his suit trousers. As time wore on, he continued to instruct his players feverishly. At times he must be exhausting to play for. In the stands here, meanwhile, Manchester City's football director Txiki Begiristain looked on covetously as Xabi Alonso curled in a free-kick at the death after the dismissal of Ivan Marcano.

The midfielder was sent off for two bookings in the 2-0 defeat at Liverpool Sunday night, but he could've seen a straight red after he caught Lucas on the ankle. The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Moussa Sissoko lunges in and makes a terrible tackle on Liverpool midfielder Lucas . The 25-year-old was sent off for a second bookable offence during Newcastle's defeat at Anfield . Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, pulling no punches. He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' Lucas goes down in pain after Sissoko's nasty challenge at Anfield on Monday night . Newcastle manager John Carver labelled Sissoko's tackle as 'indefensible' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. Sissoko is given his marching orders by referee Lee Mason after picking up two yellow cards . He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough.

Roma had initially defended strongly, but capitulated after the break. Chelsea made two changes from the side that started the quarter-final victory over Atletico Madrid last month, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Charly Musonda coming into the line-up. Andreas Christensen, who started in midfield against Atletico, was paired with Jake Clarke-Salter at centre-back, while Ola Aina and Jay DaSilva occupied the full-back positions.

A second goal followed from Christensen's excellent long ball forward, met by the run of Solanke who rounded the rushing keeper to fire into an empty net. After Boga had an attempt spilled by the keeper, Solanke was on hand to poach his second and Chelsea's third. Solanke has now netted 11 goals in this year's Youth League and is the competition's leading scorer. The rout was completed when Abraham, on from the bench, converted Kasey Palmer's cross.

The game presented both Rotherham and Brighton with an opportunity to pull away from the trouble they currently find themselves in at the wrong end of the Sky Bet Championship table. Matt Derbyshire's early finish proved to be the difference between the two teams at the AES Seal New York Stadium and moved Rotherham to just two points behind the visitors. Matt Derbyshire gets to the ball first to apply the finish and give Rotherham the lead against Brighton . David Stockdale is unable to stop Derbyshire's near post effort after a good cross by Jordan Bowery . Rotherham:\u00a0Martinez; Hunt, Rawson, Broadfoot, Lafferty, Green, Arnason, Smallwood, Pringle, Bowery (Ward 77), Derbyshire . Subs not used:\u00a0Rowe, Hammill, Milsom, Newton, Frecklington .

Booked:\u00a0Kayal, Ince . Manager: Chris Hughton . Referee: Kevin Wright . Rotheram's Ben Pringle and Brighton's Kazenga LuaLua tested the keepers at either end in the opening stages, but it was Derbyshire who made the breakthrough after eight minutes when he cleverly turned in Jordan Bowery's cross with the outside of his boot. Rotherham, who were hoping to avoid a fifth straight defeat, continued to produce the better football and chances throughout what was a stop-start first half. Bowery blew a good opportunity for the home side when Kirk Broadfoot guided a Pringle free-kick back across goal and into the striker's path, but he headed well over under little pressure. Paul Green also missed a big chance when Derbyshire slipped him the ball from a well-worked move. The midfielder delayed his shot and eventually dragged it wide of David Stockdale's goal. Brighton had to improve in the second half and brought on Leon Best for the largely ineffective Chris O'Grady. The former Nottingham Forest striker celebrates his goal at the New York Stadium . Derbyshire is congratulated by his team-mates after putting the home side a goal up on Monday . They started the second half far better and Beram Kayal, just moments after being booked for blocking a kick from goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, should have put the visitors on level terms. The Israeli international was put clean through on goal but a heavy touch gave Martinez the advantage and he managed to deny Kayal a path to goal with a diving save. The lively Best then flashed a dangerous cross into the box which Bowery poked just over his own bar for a Brighton corner. At the right end, Bowery dragged an effort just wide of the mark before a good interception from Farrend Rawson stopped Best from getting in on goal. A good run from Rotherham full-back Jack Hunt resulted in a shot on goal as the Millers tried to make the points safe. Down the other flank Danny Lafferty laid on a big chance for Derbyshire to score his second but his shot on the angle was palmed away by Stockdale. LuaLua then miscued a volley wide for the visitors but was then replaced by Craig Mackail-Smith, who was just inches away from making an immediate impact when he narrowly failed to get a touch on to Kayal's dangerous looking centre.

The hurt of losing back-to-back European and domestic finals last year took Mark McCall\u2019s men all of last summer and a good chunk of this season to overcome. This time they must lick their wounds and refocus their efforts on the Aviva Premiership after coming up short against Clermont. Clermont warm up in front of their supporters at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Etienne . Clermont centre Wesley Fofana attempts an offload following a crunching hit from Marcelo Bosch . Saracens flanker Maro Itojie secures a loose ball on the deck during a tight first half of action . There should be no shame in this defeat. Whereas Northampton capitulated embarrassingly against the same opponents a fortnight ago, Saracens stood tall on Saturday. Saracens\u2019 long-suffering chairman Nigel Wray, who has pumped tens of millions of pounds into this club over the past two decades, took the opportunity on Saturday morning to repeat his conviction that English clubs will never be able to compete with French teams if the domestic salary cap is not raised. But it can only be a matter of time before Saracens deliver. With five of their starting pack under the age of 24 \u2014 all English qualified \u2014 they have forwards who will surely develop into a world-class outfit. Twenty-year-old Maro Itoje was impressive making his first start in Europe, while the Vunipola brothers were magnificent. Ultimately the better side won, and Clermont will head into their second European final confident they can land their first European title. Saracens pressurised Clermont with the same fierce defence that knocked them so spectacularly off their stride in last year\u2019s semi-final at Twickenham. Sarries No 8 Billy Vunipola makes a strong run as\u00a0Radosavljevic tries to halt his progress . The difference this time was that Clermont knew what was coming and were able to keep their wits about them, buoyed by a partisan crowd. \u2018I\u2019ve never experienced an atmosphere like that,\u2019 said McCall. \u2019The effort and many aspects of our performance were phenomenal. We made Clermont play a a game they didn\u2019t want to play. The game was on a knife edge with 10 minutes to go but games like that are decided by small margins.\u2019 As evidence of their dominance, Clermont will point to Wesley Fofana\u2019s superbly taken second-half try and a 19th-minute incident which saw Naipolini Nalaga denied what should have been a penalty try. Chris Ashton knocked him into touch without attempting to wrap his arms around him. Saracens full back Alex Goode tries to sidestep Clermont scrum half\u00a0Ludovic Radosavljevic . But, had Jacques Burger been able to cling on to a knock-on from Nalaga with less than 10 minutes on the clock after Richard Wigglesworth\u2019s superb chase and tackle of Alex Goode\u2019s clearance, Saracens could so easily have won this game. It is hard to comprehend how the club will pick themselves up from yet another shattering defeat to deliver domestic silverware. But, after winning at Racing Metro in the quarter final while watching Premiership rivals Northampton capitulate to Clermont two weeks ago, McCall\u2019s men still have every chance of delivering a trophy this season. \u2018It won\u2019t deter us from our goal,\u2019 insisted Wigglesworth, who is playing the best rugby of his career. Richard Wigglesworth feeds the ball into a Saracens scrum as referee George Clancy watches on . \u2018It\u2019s easy to focus on the negatives when we have just lost a game like that. But we\u2019re unbelievably proud of that performance and we\u2019ve got a week to rest out battered bodies and go again.\u2019 Saracens face Northampton at Stadium MK next Saturday, before having the following weekend off when they will watch on enviously as Clermont contest the Champions Cup final at Twickenham against either Leinster or Toulon, who will go head to head on Sunday. But on reflection, Saracens will be buoyed by this performance. Itoje is a rare prospect capable of explosive bursts of power and hugely athletic around the field while Billy and Mako Vunipola are two of the most destructive carriers in Europe. They have both returned to their best following a slow start to the season, while Saracens scrum is also in fine shape. Saracens fly half Charlie Hodgson clears his lines under pressure from the Clermont defence . Charlie Hodgson missed two critical long-range penalties on Saturday but the veteran fly half has been magnificent this season and the second-half appearance of Owen Farrell from the bench saw the England No 10 make his first appearance since rupturing knee ligaments in January. With Schalk Britz and Brad Barritt both fit again, only the absence of Captain Alistair Hargreaves with concussion-related symptoms weakens McCall\u2019s squad. They will hurt from this no doubt. But in the cold light of day, Saracens will realise many of their boys became men on Saturday.

That was the surreal upshot of one of the shortest international matches in history on Thursday night, when 22 women from England and Norway\u2019s Under 19 sides got together for a couple of minutes of football. Leah Williamson stood up, a player for Arsenal Ladies but virtually anonymous in wider conversations about football. Not anymore. Leah Williamson (centre) stepped up again to take the penalty during the 18-second rematch against Norway . Williamson went the same way as her successful spot-kick last Saturday and found the net once again . Norwegian goalkeeper Oda Marie Hove Bogstad was unable to stop Williamson's brilliant effort . The England captain wheels away in celebration after handing her side a crucial 2-2 draw . The England players join the Arsenal star in celebration in front of a small crowd at the Seaview Stadium . England held on in the final moments to secure the draw and, with it, a place in this summer's finals in Israel . Williamson blows a kiss to the crowd as Mo Marley's side look ahead to this summer's tournament . Number of seconds played: 65.18 after the players returned to the centre circle . Number of England players on the pitch:\u00a0Norway were already down to 10 outfield players, but England brought on a sub to replace one injured in the game vs Switzerland . Days between spot-kicks: Five days between Saturday's clash and the controversial rematch . Number of goals scored: 1 - the infamous penalty . She found out on Wednesday that England would have to visit the Seaview Stadium in Belfast for a single penalty; she spent Thursday waiting as the frenzy grew and dragged her profile with it. But, at last, a footballer of English blood who can take a penalty. She rode the storm and tucked it away for 2-2 and a place in the European Championships this summer. Williamson said: \u2018They were the longest 24 hours of my life, I hadn't slept. I went through so many emotions and just felt excitement. \u2018We had a conversation just before I came out which was quite emotional. We have been through a bigger journey than some people go through in their whole careers because of what happened.\u2019 The broader context here was the decision that led to this tiny portion of a match being repeated five days after it was first played. England are awarded a penalty during their European U19 Women's Championships qualifier on Saturday . Referee Marija Kurtes points to the spot as England are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute . Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway in Belfast . The details are famous by now, as is the protagonist. Williamson scored a 96th-minute penalty to make it 2-2 against Norway last Saturday, but her England team-mate Rosella Ayane had encroached the box. Instead of ordering a retake, a rising German referee, Marija Kurtes made a startling error and gave Norway a free-kick. The possibilities that will arise from UEFA deciding to restage the game from the point of that mistake are fascinating. Daniel Geey, a sports lawyer at FieldFisher, told Sportsmail: \u2018Many would see this as a dangerous precedent because UEFA are intervening in an on-field refereeing mistake. \u2018UEFA need to make clear in any judgment what powers they have in extraordinary circumstances like this. There\u2019s effectively a Pandora\u2019s Box opening to clubs questioning even blatant refereeing mistakes in matches that may, for example, determine promotion or relegation.\u2019 A UEFA spokesman said: \u2018It hasn\u2019t happened so far and we have no reason to suspect leading referees would be capable of such basic errors. It is mostly a matter of experience. Some of the referees at Under 19s level will be just starting out themselves.\u2019 Williamson probably experienced more than most. According to the laws of the game, a penalty should be retaken if it entered the goal after encroachment by team-mates of the player taking the kick. Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box . Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner . Ahead of the 18-second rematch, a UEFA statement read: 'The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has ordered the match to be replayed. 'The replay of the match should be carried out as follows: . 'The match will be replayed from the minute the penalty kick was awarded to the Football Association at the European Women's Under-19 Championship 2015 match between England vs Norway played on April 4, 2015, and extended according to the discretion of the referee. German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month . England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway . But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short . Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake . But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating . German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday . 'The penalty kick shall be retaken by the Football Association. 'According to the Laws of the Game (Law 14), a team-mate of the player taking the kick infringes the Laws of the Game: . - the referee allows the kick to be taken . - if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken . - if the ball does not enter the goal, the referee stops play and the match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the infringement occurred . 'As the ball entered the goal, the kick should have been re-taken. Thus the CDEB ordered that the remaining time of the match should be replayed in accordance with article 6 (e) and 7 (2) of the disciplinary regulations. Williamson scored from the penalty spot during England's 3-1 victory against Switzerland on Thursday . Jenna Dear (right) scores with a header as England inched closer to European Championship qualification . 'Teams must field the same players which were on the pitch at that moment. Any of these players can take the penalty kick.' An FA spokesperson said: 'After England Women U19s' match against Norway on Saturday, April 4, the FA lodged an appeal to UEFA following a disallowed penalty. 'Due to an incorrect application of the game's laws by the match referee, UEFA have ordered the match to be replayed from the point of the penalty. 'The remainder of the match will be played on Thursday at 9.45pm at the same stadium \u2013 Seaview, Belfast.' Williamson is congratulated by her England team-mates after scoring past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot . Former Everton and England captain Mo Marley is head coach of the national women's U19 team . Although it only lasted around 50 seconds, officials, stewards and paramedics were all required to attend and admission was free for fans. England, coached by former national captain Mo Marley, were 2-0 down to Norway on Saturday before substitute Ayane pulled one back in the 87th minute to give her side hope of claiming a point. However, Wiliiamson's penalty was disallowed and the match ended in defeat. England brushed off the disappointment on Monday, though, with a 9-1 win against Northern Ireland. Both England and Norway had to start the match with the same players who finished Saturday's match and both teams had completed what should have been the final round of Group 4 matches just hours earlier on Thursday. Marley's side defeated Switzerland 3-1 as Jenna Dear scored twice at the Seaview Stadium either side of another Williamson spot-kick as she scored past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot from 12-yards. The controversial decision further complicated the already complex qualification process for July's finals after UEFA had announced that Norway had sealed their place regardless of the result in Belfast. After an initial qualifying round last year, the Elite Round is comprised of six groups of four teams playing at locations across Europe. The six group winners and best-placed runner-up (Norway) - decided by the best record against the first and third-placed teams in the groups - went through to join hosts Israel at the showpiece event in July. England women's senior head coach Mark Sampson tweeted: 'Difficult circumstances for our @england U19.\u00a0I have been proud that in challenging circumstances you have conducted yourselves superbly & represented your country with great pride. 'Regardless of final outcome you should be very proud. We are very proud of you.' September 2005 - World Cup qualifier - Uzbekistan vs Bahrain . Uzbekistan had won the opening leg of the Asian zone fourth-round play-off 1-0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching. Rather than retaking the penalty, an indirect free-kick was wrongly awarded by Japanese referee Toshimitsu Yoshida\u00a0to Bahrain and the game ended with a one-goal margin. Uzbekistan called for an investigation but were left furious after FIFA ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid. It proved to have a major impact as it was Bahrain who eventually went through with a 1-1 away goals victory, though they were later beaten in the AFC-CONCACAF play-off.

It wasn't good enough in the first half but listen, we got the three points. Drogba looks on as his effort from inside the box drifts in to the far corner past goalkeeper Schmeichel . \u2018We've been the best side all season.

A day they again stamped their serious play-off credentials down on the Championship, humiliating their once superior neighbours. As Stuart Dallas thundered in his second of the afternoon, boos descended down on Kit Symons, who slunk back into his dugout. But this wasn\u2019t about Fulham and their mounting deficiencies. There were hairy moments for Mark Warburton\u2019s side - particularly after Ross McCormack\u2019s 67th minute penalty halved the deficit - but they continue to chip away at those above them with a fearless way of playing the game, excitement in abundance. Brentford celebrate taking the lead against Fulham at Craven Cottage thanks to Stuart Dallas (second left) Dallas runs away to celebrate his second goal of the game just before the hour mark at Craven Cottage . Fulham (4-4-2):\u00a0Bettinelli 6; Grimmer 5 (Hoogland 46, 5), Bodurov 5, Turner 5, Husband 6; Fofana 5, Guthrie 5, Tunnicliffe 5; Kacaniklic 6 (Kavanagh 78), Woodrow 5 (Smith 62, 6.5), McCormack 5.5 .

Here was a first league double over Fulham in 23 years and still the potential for a play-off campaign, although the manager might be looking for more. \u2018If a team puts a run together they\u2019ll go clear with 90-odd points,\u2019 he reasoned. \u2018If they do that, with the nature of the fixtures, teams will drop points. \u2018The average for the play-offs has been 72 for the last five years. I think you\u2019ll need 75 minimum. If that\u2019s the case we need two more wins.\u2019 Every single resident of the tiny area of west London would have snatched and bitten fingers off for that if offered in August. The celebrations after Alan Judge\u2019s stunning late free-kick were almost muted, such was the shock at what they\u2019d just seen, and delirium as Jota smashed in a fourth. The guard has been changed around these parts and, when Symons looks back on the video today, he\u2019ll have serious misgivings as to how the little upstarts five miles down the road were allowed to humble Fulham in their own back yard. \u2018People will look at the scoreline and think it\u2019s a hammering but it isn\u2019t,\u2019 he said. Sadly, Symons was wrong. What he could not legislate for was the oceans gifted to Alex Pritchard in the build-up to Dallas\u2019 opener. The excellent Pritchard, on loan from Tottenham, is a midfielder with the brightest of futures, someone adept at orchestrating the Bees. So when he picked up possession inside his own half, looked up and just saw vacant grass ahead of him, the alarm bells should have been ringing in the hosts\u2019 defence. But they did not. Pritchard went on for 30 yards, recycled possession just outside the home box and - later in the move - Dallas manouvered enough space for himself to put his laces through a daisy-cutter across Marcus Bettinelli into the goalkeeper\u2019s bottom left-hand post. The first phase of that attack gives an indication why the Cottagers have struggled so badly this term and still aren\u2019t safe from relegation. That, and a failure to take their chances when on top. Cauley Woodrow saw two presentable opportunities go begging before Seko Fofana - all alone at the back post - could only skew an effort wide with goal gaping. Alexander Kacaniklic earlier jinked away from two defenders but saw a shot smartly saved by David Button. McCormack, the multi-million pound signing from Leeds last summer, became increasingly on the periphery; starting as one of two strikers, the Scot felt the need to constantly drop off into midfield, such was Fulham\u2019s lack of creativity. All that meant was Woodrow had to fend for himself against the two aggressive central defenders Harlee Dean and James Tarkowski. Ross McCormack scored from the penalty spot with 23 minutes remaining to drag Fulham back into the game . In short, Fulham need a plan for next season - and quickly. Even though it looks as if they will remain in the division, their supporters will not accept another campaign of stagnation. Compare that to buoyant Brentford, who are on a crest of a wave and unsure where the next six weeks will take them for all the right reasons. They grew into this, comfortable in retaining the ball after half-time and looked every bit the play-off side. Dallas\u2019 second of the afternoon was something to behold, a wondrous strike in the same direction as his first but into the roof of Bettinelli\u2019s net from 30 yards out. Up went the inflatables, over went the arms in hugging celebration. Brentford\u2019s supporters can\u2019t quite believe what they are witnessing. To say their brand of football does not deserve these accolades would be to decry Warburton\u2019s hard work over the course of 18 months. It is just a shame he will not see that through beyond May. Fulham's Ryan Tunnicliffe is tackled by Brentford's James Tarkowski and Jake Bidwell . Brentford goalkeeper David Button  saves shot from Alexander Kacaniklic of Fulham . It ought to have been three when Andre Gray blazed over from six yards but, just as the visitors looked to be cruising to the points, referee Simon Hooper gifted Fulham a way back into the game. Toumani Diagouraga was harshly adjudged to have hauled down debutant James Husband, with McCormack doing the rest from 12 yards. Lanky Matt Smith was a menace when introduced, almost catching Button out with a cheeky lob as Fulham pressed hard for an equaliser. Tarkowski needed to stretch every inch of his giant frame to keep out Kacaniklic too. They\u2019ll need a bit more of that if this adventure is to finish at Wembley, although the quality of Judge\u2019s late free-kick might just be even more important. Was this Warburton\u2019s best individual result as a manager? \u2018No, and I don\u2019t mean that in a derogatory way,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s a big local derby and the atmosphere was electric. Brentford's Moses Odubajo challenges Fulham midfielder Danny Guthrie for the ball . \u2018We\u2019ve had momentum from day one, not in an arrogant way but we have. It\u2019s self belief. The players deserve to be where they are.\u2019 They weren\u2019t finished there, Jota hammering home in stoppage-time to cap off a stunning move.

It turns out the 55-year-old has been attending regular Zumba classes, and it's paid off. The Scottish presenter revealed that attending the classes - up to four times a week - has helped her drop two dress sizes, from a 14 to a 10. Scroll down for video . Lorraine Kelly (pictured left) has managed to drop two dress sizes by attending regular Zumba classes with her instructor, Maxine Jones (pictured right) Zumba is a fitness programme, combining Latin and international music, and incorporates aerobic elements across various styles of dance. The classes vary in price, but average at about \u00a35. In an interview with\u00a0Woman, Kelly gushed about\u00a0her Zumba instructor, Maxine Jones. She said: 'Maxine's changed my life. I have more energy now and that helps me look and feel younger.' In the interview, the 55-year-old also revealed her excitement about her new weight loss. As the presenter of her own eponymous ITV show, which airs early in the morning every weekday, it's understandable that feeling good in front of the camera is important to Kelly. The 55-year old is no stranger to exercise, and ran the London Marathon back in 2010 . Zumba is a dance fitness programme that combines several dance styles and aerobic activity . She explained: 'I've never had a waist before, I didn't have that curviness, but now I have and I look better. 'I'm a size 10 and I love being able to go into the shops and buy a top because I like it and not because I want to hide my bottom.' Kelly also explained that Zumba had helped her develop a new-found confidence, and that at the age of 55, she had more confidence than she had ever felt. She added: 'I was never unfit, but I was never truly fit. I'd done marathons but more out of determination. 'But Zumba is so much fun\u2026I feel more confident now in my fifties than I have ever felt. Confidence comes from within.' And Lorraine also found a friend for life in instructor Maxine. Maxine started instructing in 2011, and prior to this, had been a banker for 20 years. She explained: 'Maxine's more like a friend now \u2013 she makes me laugh. 'She's 45 and I'm 55 \u00ad\u2013 we always joke that our combined ages add up to 100!'

The Chiefs outscored their opponents six tries to one at Sandy Park, with a David Ewers score and a penalty try helping the home side into a 17-6 half-time lead. Exeter then added further tries through Thomas Waldrom, Byron McGuigan, Sam Hill and Dean Mumm after the break, with outclassed Newcastle only able to respond with a 68th-minute effort from Chris Harris and eight points from the boot of Tom Catterick. Carl Rimmer of Exeter Chiefs is tackled by Newcastle Falcons' Dom Barrow during match at Sandy Park . Exeter's Thomas Waldrom stretches over for a try during the European Rugby Challenge Cup match . The victory means Exeter will take on Gloucester at Kingsholm in two weeks' time for a place in the final against either Newport Gwent Dragons or the winner of Sunday's London Irish-Edinburgh encounter. The hosts made a number of changes from the side that lost 25-18 at Leicester in the Premiership last weekend with McGuigan, Ben Moon, Tomas Francis and Tom James being drafted in. The Chiefs were also forced into a late change with Damian Welch pulling-up in the warm-up so Ben White was promoted from the bench to play in the back row, skipper Mumm moved into the second row and Sam Skinner added to the replacements. Newcastle, who lost 46-17 to Exeter in the Premiership last month, started with two changes in the backs from the side that narrowly lost at London Irish with Juan Pablo Socino in the centre and Harris on the right wing. Both defences were tested in the opening 10 minutes but it was Exeter who made the first breakthrough just before the quarter-hour. Dave Ewers of Exeter Chiefs (centre) makes a break during his side's 48-13 victory against the Falcons . After the Falcons were forced to touch down over their own line, Exeter broke off the back of the five-metre scrum and Ewers barged over the line. Slade added the extras from out wide on the right and the Chiefs were under way. Exeter increased their advantage midway through the half when wing Matt Jess, who was on course to score from a loose ball, was pulled back twice off the ball by full-back Alex Tait. Referee Marius Mitrea had no hesitation in awarding a penalty try - which Slade converted - and Tait went to the sin-bin. Newcastle kept the Chiefs at bay while they were a man down and when they were back to full strength the visitors were awarded a penalty 12 metres out in front of the posts, which fly-half Catterick slotted over to get his side off the mark. Slade and Catterick then swapped penalties to leave Exeter with an 11-point lead at the interval. Dan Temm of Newcastle Falcons tackles Thomas Waldrom during the quarter-final encounter . That soon became 18 points as just 45 seconds after the restart Ewers broke from inside his own half, shrugged off a couple of half tackles, before offloading to number eight Waldrom to stretch for the line. Slade converted and, 12 minutes later, added his second penalty from 30 metres out to make it 27-6. The Chiefs' fourth try came just before the hour-mark when Will Chudley chipped over the head of the defence and into the arms of McGuigan to go over, with Slade again adding the conversion. The Falcons may have looked down and out but Harris rounded a couple of forwards to score a breakaway try under the posts with Catterick converting to cut the deficit to 34-13. However, the Chiefs replied immediately through Hill to help restore their advantage and then Hill turned provider for Mumm to score the Chiefs' sixth and final try, with replacement fly-half Gareth Steenson converting both to cap a one-sided triumph.", "candidate": "Exeter Chiefs defeated Newcastle Falcons 48-13 in European Challenge Cup.

{"id": "c85be20ec9b5b59a15655fb594117536915f2877-1", "article": "Louis van Gaal couldn\u2019t let the moment pass. Manchester United had just rattled off their 13th home win of the season and the Dutchman wanted to crank up the pressure. A comfortable victory over Aston Villa, inspired by two goals from the excellent Ander Herrera and crowned by Wayne Rooney\u2019s magnificent strike, had seen United leap above Manchester City in the table for the first time since November 23, 2013. When you think on January 10 this year the gap between the two clubs was 10 points, the turnaround has been remarkable. But now, as they head into their latest local squabble, there is mounting confidence around Old Trafford that United will not surrender their position. Louis van Gaal has piled pressure on Manchester City ahead of their games against Crystal Palace and United . Manchester United picked up all three points at the weekend by beating Aston Villa 3-1 at Old Trafford . Van Gaal believes Manchester City's players may struggle to get to grips with being in fourth spot . MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3): De Gea 6; Valencia 7, Jones 7, Rojo 7, Blind 7: Herrera 8.5, Carrick 7, Fellaini 6.5 (Falcao 77mins): Mata 7.5, Rooney 8, Young 6.5 (Di Maria 70. 6.5) Subs not used: Valdes, Rafael, Januzaj, McNair, Pereira . Scorers: Herrera 43, 90, Rooney 79 . ASTON VILLA (4-4-2): Guzan 7: Hutton 5.5 (Bacuna 46, 5), Okore 5.5, Clark 5.5, Lowton 5: N\u2019Zogbia 5 (Baker 61, 5) , Sanchez 6, Delph 6, Weimann 5 (Cole 77): Benteke 6.5, Agbonlahor 5 . Subs not used: Given, Vlaar, Gil, Grealish . Booked:\u00a0Delph . Scorer: Benteke 80 . Man of the match: Ander Herrera . Referee: Roger East 6 . Is it feasible for City to finish fourth? They face Crystal Palace on Monday evening and Van Gaal believes dropping down two positions will creep into the psychology of Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s squad. Even if City win at Selhurst Park, how will they handle the furnace that awaits this Sunday? \u2018It plays a part in the spirit of the players \u2014 of our opponents but also our players,\u2019 said Van Gaal. \u2018We have more confidence now and when (if) they lose a point against Crystal Palace, then it is also sitting in their minds. \u2018I don\u2019t know the individual players of Manchester City so well, so I cannot judge them. But we have a lot of confidence and we haven\u2019t lost so many times at home. The next game is going to be the decisive game.\u2019 Van Gaal is aware recent history spells doom for United. They have lost seven of the last nine Manchester derbies, including each of the last four. Remarkably, they have not beaten City at home since Rooney scored that breath-taking bicycle kick in February 2011. City, few would dispute, have the better squad but, regardless of what happens in south London, will they be able to hold United\u2019s momentum? Can they match their spirit? Big games are bringing the best out of Van Gaal\u2019s men and they are clearly relishing the opportunity that awaits. Manchester United have not beaten City at Old Trafford since Wayne Rooney's wonder goal in February 2011 . Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero scored in his side's 1-0 win over United back in November . Rooney likes playing against Villa \u2014 this was his 13th career goal against them. Newcastle (12) are his second favourite opponents. Man United lead rivals Man City by one point . \u2018It was another Manchester United, I believe,\u2019 said Van Gaal, when asked how he reflected on the 1-0 defeat he suffered at the Etihad Stadium in November. \u2018We have developed the team. That was more in the start of the process and now we are in the end of the process. \u2018So I think also the confidence of our players is very high at the moment but also our performances shows that so it\u2019s not the same Manchester United. It\u2019s like the game against Liverpool and the game (coming up) against Chelsea \u2014 you have to win these kinds of matches.\u2019 With Liverpool\u2019s defeat by Arsenal effectively ending the doubt over which sides will finish in the top four, it now becomes a question of what order Chelsea, Arsenal and the two Manchester clubs will be after the final games have been played. United\u2019s run-in is laced with demanding assignments \u2014 aside from City, they must go to Stamford Bridge on April 18, face a trip to Goodison Park the following week and host Arsenal on May 16 \u2014 but they have an aura once more. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling saw red during the Premier League clash at the Etihad Stadium . Man United vs Man City - April 12 . Chelsea vs Man United - April 18 . Everton vs Man United - April 26 . Man United vs West Brom - May 2 . Crystal Palace vs Man United - May 9 . Man United vs Arsenal - May 17 . Hull vs Man United - May 24 . Crystal Palace vs Man City - April 6 . Man United vs Man City - April 12 . Man City vs West Ham - April 19 . Man City vs Aston Villa - April 25 . Tottenham vs Man City - May 3 . Man City vs QPR - May 10 . Swansea vs Man City - May 17 . Man City vs Southampton - May 24 . Villa, stymied by injury problems that Tim Sherwood described as \u2018crippling\u2019, simply couldn\u2019t cope once they went conceded in the 43rd minute and the manager, who was noticeably glum afterwards, can at least take solace from the fact Queens Park Rangers will not offer the same threat on Tuesday. \u2018We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, it\u2019s going to be a great game,\u2019 said Ashley Young, who admitted he was \u2018disappointed\u2019 to not be selected for the last round of England games. \u2018Hopefully we will get the three points. Of course it would be nice but we are just taking each game as it comes.\u2019 There was never any hint they would slip up here, bossing the first half and then going through the gears after a slow period after the break to swat Villa aside. Herrara, with his slick passing and industry, was terrific. Rooney\u2019s 14th strike of the campaign, meanwhile, was sensational. \u2018It's about momentum, especially when you are going into this vital stage of the season,\u2019 Young added. \u2018United teams always come strong at this stage and we are showing in every game just how strong we can be \u2013 and even how we finish the game. We will enjoy this but it is all about next week.\u2019 Ashley Young (left, pictured with Herrera) believes his side are building momentum ahead of the derby .", "candidate": "Manchester United beat Aston Villa 3-1 at Old Trafford on Saturday.

Dimitri Harrell reportedly pulled out his gun and pointed it at 19-year-old Samirria White after they started arguing over his 'infidelity' in the bedroom of their St Paul apartment at around 3.40am. Carrying the couple's three-month-old child, he then shot Miss White in the face at close range, according to police.\u00a0When medics arrived at the scene, they pronounced the young mother dead. Now, Harrell, who later admitted to having stored his handgun under his daughter's mattress, has been charged\u00a0with one count of second-degree murder at Ramsey County District Court. Shooting: Dimitri Harrell (right) has been arrested after allegedly shooting dead his fianc\u00e9e, Samirria White (left), at their Minnesota home on Easter morning while holding their baby daughter (center) in his arms . The suspect, who had  'trust issues' with Miss White after having two children by another woman, remains in custody in lieu of $200,000 bail. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison. In the moments before Sunday's shooting, Harris had been arguing with Miss White after he had vanished from the apartment several times during the night, arousing her suspicions, relatives said. During an interview with police, the suspect apparently told officers he had then tried to pull his gun - which he had bought several days earlier - from his pocket while holding the couple's baby daughter. However, the weapon had accidentally discharged, he said, causing a bullet to strike Miss White in the face, according to the Star Tribune. It is unclear whether he explained why he took out the gun. Tragic: Harrell reportedly pulled out his gun and fired at 19-year-old Miss White (pictured with their daughter) after they started arguing over his 'infidelity' in the bedroom of their St Paul apartment at around 3.40am . Arrest: Now, Harrell has been charged with one count of second-degree murder at Ramsey County District Court. Above, the suspect is pictured in his mug shot (left) and posing with Miss White and their baby (right) Several people - including some of the victim's siblings - were also in the property at the time of the alleged murder. Many of them heard yelling come from the couple's bedroom,\u00a0CBS\u00a0reported. Miss White's 16-year-old brother, who woke up after apparently hearing his sister scream 'Don't point that gun at me!',  ran into the room when he heard the gunshot. There, he found his sister dead . The boy yelled at Harrell to get away from Miss White, according to a complaint obtained by the Tribune. In response, the suspect apparently told him it was an accident and fled the scene. After emergency crews arrived at the scene, Miss White was declared dead and the bedroom was cordoned off. Police later found the gun on Harrell's 'close friend', who was in the apartment. Scene: The shooting occurred in the 800 block of Pierce Butler Route (pictured) in Minnesota on Sunday . Family: In the moments before Sunday's shooting, Harris had been arguing with Miss White after he had vanished from the apartment several times during the night, arousing her suspicions, relatives said . The man, who has not been identified by officials, had reportedly received the weapon from Harrell just minutes after the shooting. The suspect had apparently told him: 'Do something with this'. Harrell, who is pictured with Miss White and their daughter in numerous Facebook photos,  told police that their relationship had been rocky since the births of his  two children by a different woman. On Tuesday, relatives described Miss White, a former Humboldt Senior High School student, as a 'spontaneous' and loving woman who had hoped to become a nurse and adored her daughter.

Unless one of the top four falter dramatically in the final six Premier League games of the season, Liverpool will also miss out on Champions League qualification after only a season back in Europe's elite club competition. Brendan Rodgers undoubtedly needs to reinforce his squad, and Sportsmail assesses Liverpool's chances of landing five of their main targets. DANNY INGS,\u00a0BURNLEY . Danny Ings has impressed at Burnley this season and is set to leave Turf Moor when his contract expires . Mario Balotelli (left) and Rickie Lambert appear set to depart Liverpool at the end of the season . Liverpool have made their play for Ings but his concern has always been that he gets a fair chance of making a starting place his own. The Reds will look to shed Borini, Lambert and Balotelli but Divock Origi arrives from Lille in June too. Manchester United, Manchester City and Real Sociedad remain in the frame for Ings. COST: \u00a0\u00a34million compensation fee . JAMES MILNER,\u00a0MANCHESTER CITY . Has been a little upset by all accounts that his move to Liverpool was reported almost as a done deal. James Milner appears set to depart Manchester City at the end of the season when his contract expires . Milner (right) is also a target for Arsenal and Everton, as well as Serie A sides Roma and Inter Milan . Wants to see what City discuss first and it is all about how many games he plays. Arsenal, Everton, Roma and Inter Milan have also spoken to his representative about a summer deal. COST: Free . PETR CECH,\u00a0CHELSEA .

Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech (right) appears likely to depart Stamford Bridge before next season . Cech could be out of reach for Liverpool if Paris Saint-Germain make a move for the goalkeeper . They want Cech but don't have the budget to compete with Paris Saint-Germain, who are confident of signing the experienced Chelsea goalkeeper this summer ahead of Arsenal. COST: \u00a310million . ASIER ILLARRAMENDI,\u00a0REAL MADRID . Stylish young central midfielder who has lost his way among Real Madrid's stars. Asier Illarramendi may depart Real Madrid this summer and his profile matches Liverpool's recruitment policy . Has stated a desire to fight for his place but knows chances are limited. Liverpool like him, as they do Ruben Neves at Porto also, but face competition from Arsenal and Real Sociedad although Arsene Wenger has other targets too for that area. COST: \u00a318million . MEMPHIS DEPAY, PSV EINDHOVEN . Fits the bill for Brendan Rodgers in terms of pace and pressing style and carries a goal threat. PSG have also made enquiries, as have United, who hope Louis Van Gaal's presence can sway the deal their way. Memphis Depay (right) is an ideal signing for Brendan Rodgers, but he must compete with Europe's elite side .

The Latics may be heading for relegation but they proved they are ready to go down fighting after twice coming from behind to snatch a point at Craven Cottage. Caldwell, at 32 the youngest boss in the league, only replaced the axed Malky Mackay on Wednesday and must have feared the worst when his side conceded after just three minutes to Ross McCormack's strike. Gary Caldwell admitted his first taste of management was 'crazy' following Wigan's battling 2-2 draw . Wigan's Jason Pearce (right) is congratulated by Pennant (left) as he scores the second equaliser for his side . A stylish Jermaine Pennant free-kick hauled Wigan level, only for a stunning long-range effort from Matt Smith put Fulham back in front. But Jason Pearce's 69th-minute effort, when he tucked in a corner at the far post, earned the Latics a point. 'I have just said to the players that I feel very proud of them considering we only had two days to work,' said former Latics skipper Caldwell. 'It's crazy, absolutely crazy. An all-consuming job. But I loved every minute of it and can't wait for the next one. I've had a lot of managers texting me saying 'welcome to the madhouse' and I can see what they mean.' A point lifted Wigan above Millwall, who they face on Tuesday, on goal difference but both teams are seven points adrift of safety. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle, but he still insists there is plenty to play for. 'We'll try to win every game,' he added. 'There's 12 points to play for and we'll try to win every one and see what happens. 'It's going to be a long process to get the club to where we want it to be. But tonight was the way we want to play, that's how this club got success.' Fulham should now be safe, having edged nine points clear of the drop zone, but they were booed off by sections of the home support. Boss Kit Symons' honeymoon period seems to be over, as his decision to take off goalscorer Smith after an hour was met with a chorus of 'you don't know what you're doing'. Fulham captain Scott Parker (right) is hassled for the ball by Wigan's Gaetan Bong (left) at Craven Cottage . The ever industrious Parker (left) dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan's\u00a0Kim Bo-Kyung (right) 'Matt was shattered,' he explained. 'He's had a lot of football recently and we needed some fresh legs.' Symons has the air of a manager who cannot wait for the season to come to an end. 'It's glass half full, glass half empty,' he added. 'We're a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. 'It's been a tough season, to put it mildly, and realistically it was probably always going to be like that.

Her car had been towed from the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant in Virginia, where she left it overnight on Easter Weekend. When she picked it up, infuriated, she resorted to insulting the employee's looks, intelligence, and social status. But despite viewers' calls for harsher punishment, the network has reinstated the 28-year-old to her role with a spot on SportsCenter this weekend. Confirming the news to Sports Illustrated, senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said: 'She knows she made a mistake. She\u2019s owned up to it. I think she is just really anxious to get back to work.' Scroll down for video . She's back! Britt McHenry (left) has been reinstated as an ESPN sports reporter after being filmed attacking tow clerk Gina Michelle (right) for her looks and social status in a video the sparked mass outrage . Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry was suspended for one week after the April 6 video surfaced . Markman insisted 'she has a lot of potential as a reporter', adding, 'she is young, she\u2019s learning some things, but I really do believe in her.' He continued: 'We had a conversation where we both talked about that it would take time and it will be hard. She knows that, and especially at the beginning. 'She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers. We expect that from her, and I expect that from her. 'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn\u2019t make me think she will rebound from this. But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy.' Online petitions for McHenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office, where clerk Gina Michelle was stood behind the counter.

Michelle can be heard warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding:\u00a0'That\u2019s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this. Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras . Warning: Since Britt McHenry's outburst, this sign has been placed on the door of the Chinese restaurant .

Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Michelle patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money\u2026 with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling Michelle she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f*****g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Although she issued an apology on Twitter, the sportscaster did not approach Michelle directly. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . Hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on Twitter as ESPN refuses to comment further . At first, McHenry tweeted insisting she had been in the right. But that post was deleted within hours. Employees at the beer hall-cum-Chinese-restaurant Hunan Number One told Daily Mail Online the sports reporter left her car in the parking lot overnight despite clear signs on the door that cars will be towed, warning bar-goers that the restaurant would not be responsible 'if your car is towed from the parking lot'. The venue, which features 'happy hour' from 11am until 9pm, was described by enthusiastic patrons as a prime 'pre-game' spot and online reviewers as a beloved dive bar. Hunan Number One, offers sushi, hot-wings and other bar food, along with 32oz draft beers for around $8, five-buck highballs and half-price bottles of wine, served up in front of big screen TVs playing sports.

The firm showed\u00a0magnanimity, saying it did not want McHenry to\u00a0suffer. In a statement Advanced Towing said: 'Parking enforcement is contentious by nature. At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry.

That's what happened to cyclist Wang Pingan as he neared the end of a two-wheel trek that covered thousands of miles through every major province in the vast country, according to local media. Arriving in the southern city of Shenzhen, in southern Guandong province, Wang locked up his trusty mountain bike, loaded with panniers, to check out electronics markets in the city's Huaqiangbei area. Within 10 minutes the thieves struck. But here's where the story takes an unexpected turn. Despite police initially saying odds were stacked against the bike ever being recovered, Shenzhen's finest managed to track it down and return it. The Southern Metro News reported that police apprehended an alleged criminal and sent Wang a photo of a bike they recovered. He recognized it instantly. They said the theft, from a road junction \"infested\" by cycle thieves was caught on surveillance cameras. The bike had likely been sold twice before being recovered. \"We don't want this lad visiting Shenzhen and having a bad memory of the city,\" a police spokesman told the paper. Now, with 29,200 kilometers under his tires, Wang can continue the final few days of his epic journey.

Before the bike's recovery, Wang had posted a heart-rending tribute to his bike on social media, recalling their adventures together. \"The bicycle itself doesn't have a high value, but spending more than a year with it, it's like a best friend who has accompanied me on my way, and taken me to every place without complaints,\" he writes. \"Thank you, my buddy, maybe I'll never see you again ...

In another room, my grandfather could not comprehend what was happening and, instead of seeking cover, drifted towards the window. Outside, a brown dust-cloud rose from the ruins of cottages that had dotted the next hill. I was at my uncle's place in Ramkot, west Kathmandu, some 12 kilometers (7.4 miles) east from my family home. After escaping the building for the safety of open air, my first thought was for news of friends and family. Calls didn't go through but thankfully texts and data did. I heard from everyone except my mother. Worried sick, I foolishly went into the house for a second time to get my belongings and leave for home. Another tremor -- the first of many to aftershocks that have continued to strike an already traumatized city -- shook the house. I took refuge under the same doorway. The journey towards my family home in Sifal was a map of quake destruction, with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart. A high wall surrounding a monastery had collapsed and the nuns had run to a nearby field. A mud-and-brick cottage had fallen on a blue motorbike but no trace could be found of its rider. A woman perched on top of rubble tried to reach for a water container from what used to be her kitchen. Everywhere, survivors gathered wherever they could find open space -- fields, private compounds, empty roadside lots. In Chhauni, an ice cream seller ran double-time with his cart, while his radio relayed the latest. Further ahead, a mother and daughter sat down on a pavement so that a grandchild could be fed. Across the Bishnumati River, uphill towards Maru, I ran to get away from the tall houses and made towards the Kathmandu Durbar Area. It was reduced to rubble. A blood donation camp was said to be buried by the same structure that sheltered it. Locals were searching for survivors, but progress was slow. The Kasthamandap temple had caved in. Temples that sat on impressive staircase-style pyramids were now dust. The western fa\u00e7ade of the Basantapur palace had fallen apart and nothing remained of the remained of the nine-story medieval palace nearby. Meanwhile, the curio fleamarket was flooded with people who had made it out of the cramped quarters of Jhocchen, Indra Chowk, New Road, and nearby neighborhoods. In Putalisadak, I met a cousin who was sitting an entrance exam for a prestigious high school when the quake hit before the allotted time was over. He kept wondering out loud whether he could retake the test. The two of us walked through Bagbajar, trying to trace a few acquaintances, and up Dillibajar to Kamalpokhari. A hawker was selling momos -- a Nepalese type of dumpling -- under a seven-story building, while policemen guarded a jailhouse. People gathered mostly in the middle of crossroads, on traffic islands and around metal pulpits, which looked out of range of falling buildings. The aftershocks kept coming. I reached home and found both my parents alive and uninjured. I couldn't believe that our 30-year-old house was still standing. As I walked my cousin to where his parents were, we kept hearing rumors:  \"More quakes forecast by experts for 5 p.m. and midnight.\" As if to confirm, tremors shook us at six and more would follow at 10 p.m. and midnight, with smaller shocks throughout the night. Along the northern boundary of the former royal museum, the wall had collapsed and people had poured out of the Uttar Dhoka neighborhood onto the palace lawn. Green military tents meant for two people were now packed with six and the army was trying hard to accommodate as many as possible. In Thamel, an electricity pole had squashed an abandoned taxi. A few men took turns taking photos with the wrecked car. In Kantipath, a handful of backpackers were discussing where to make camp. Back home, my parents decided against going to the nearby Sifal Chaur football field where families were sleeping on plastic mattresses under rudimentary tents. Instead, their tactic was to stay on the ground floor, be awakened by tremors, and then scamper to a corner of our garden that seemed relatively safe. I did not sleep a wink.", "candidate": "Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, was rocked by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on Tuesday.

The Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab is responsible for the attack in the center of Mogadishu, group spokesman Abu Musab said. The attack began when two suicide bombers detonated their car at the entrance of the two-story building housing the Ministry of Education, Culture & Higher Education, Somali National Security Ministry spokesman Mohamed Yusuf said. Five gunmen then entered the building, shooting people inside, Yusuf said. Security guards at the building, and, later, Somali special forces battled the gunmen inside, witnesses said. Soldiers from the African Union, who are in Somalia in part to support the government's fight against Al-Shabaab, teamed up with Somali security forces to shoot and kill the five attackers, Yusuf said. The attack killed four Somali soldiers and eight civilians, according to Yusuf. The special forces helped people out of the building while the attack was underway, city police Capt. Mohamud Abdi said. Ali Hassan, a man who was helped from the building, confirmed that a rescue operation was happening inside. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has battled the country's government for years, aiming to overthrow it and turn the nation into a fundamentalist Islamic state. In recent years, the group also launched terror attacks beyond Somalia's borders, sometimes targeting non-Muslims. What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want? Earlier this month, Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in neighboring Kenya, killing 147 people, mostly students. The terrorists separated Christians from Muslims and shot those who couldn't recite verses from the Quran, witnesses said. In Somalia, Al-Shabaab has been blamed for attacks that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. Late last month, Al-Shabaab militants detonated a bomb and sprayed bullets at a Mogadishu hotel, leaving at least 20 people dead in an attack that lasted a number of hours.

In a perfect display of couple slimming, Beyonce and Jay Z dropped the pounds together at the end of 2013 by going vegan for 22 days. The singer used her Instagram account to post pictures of her healthy-looking meals which included such delights as vegan mac and cheese and portobello mushrooms. The 22-day challenge wasn't the first time the star has shared her meal plans. Before filming Dreamgirls in 2006, it was revealed that Beyonce, who once called herself 'a natural fat person, just dying to get out,' had undergone a master cleanse. Healthy meals galore! Beyonce shared her delicious-looking vegan diet snaps with her followers . During Beyonce and Jay Z's vegan diet,  the singers posted pictures of their meals, which included mac'n'cheese and portobello mushrooms to Beyonce's Instagram account . The singer lost a total of 20lbs drinking a concoction of purified water, organic lemon juice, maple syrup and cayenne pepper. She allowed herself just one cheat day a week where she would eat pizza and drink wine. In the past, the world-famous star has admitted to cutting back to stay in shape. During an interview with Bang magazine, the 33-year-old was said to have eaten just six slices of tomato and four pieces of cucumber for her lunch. The singer said of her meagre lunch: 'I have to. Photos make you fatter, television adds pounds, and discipline is very important in this profession. I am not naturally skinny. I am a real woman, I've got curves.' The Queen of discipline: Madonna maintains her slim figure with a macrobiotic diet which means she cannot eat wheat, eggs, meat or diary . Madonna: Macrobiotic . Madonna has made little secret of her strict macrobiotic diet in which she cannot eat wheat, eggs, meats or dairy. Meals for Madonna, 56, could mean miso soup and brown rice for breakfast, or tofu cheese and quinoa salad for lunch. It is also thought that the singer abstains from alcohol and caffeine and drinks up to three litres of water a day. Madonna has previously admitted in an interview that she never craves cheeseburgers and that she never cooks her own meals. Gwyneth Paltrow is well known for her 'good' diet which sees her largely following a vegan meal plan . Gwyneth Paltrow: Eating good .

Gwyneth then follows a largely vegan diet which includes snacking on beans and having quinoa or soup for dinner and lunch. The actress is so passionate about her diet that she even launched two cookbooks, one of which is called 'It's All Good'. In the book, she advocates the elimination of: 'dairy, eggs, sugar, corn, wheat, gluten, potatoes, tomatoes, red meat, shell or deep-water fish.' But Gwyneth still allows herself to drink alcohol: 'I really like a martini or a glass of red wine in the evening', she said. 'I think it\u2019s a really nice way to say, \u201cOK, it\u2019s adult time now.\u201d Having lived in England for so long, I have become a real booze hound.' Victoria Beckham follows an alkaline diet which bans acid forming foods such as starchy grains and vegetables . Victoria Beckham: Honestly Healthy . In 2013 Victoria Beckham, 40, who is known for her super-slim figure, tweeted that she was enjoying the alkaline diet book, Honestly Healthy by Natasha Corrett and Vicki Edgson. The ultra-strict regime warns against \u2018very acid forming\u2019 foods like starchy grains and vegetables such as pasta, wheat and beans, all dairy products, meat fish and shellfish.' Also banned are tea, coffee, sugar, fizzy drinks including soda and tonic water and, of course, alcohol. While following the plan, at least 70 per cent of your diet should be alkaline, while the other 30 per cent can be acidic, which basically means a lot of fruit and vegetables. Jennifer Aniston follows the Aitkens diet, which is high in protein and low in carbohydrate . Jennifer Aniston: Atkins . Ms Aniston has long been linked to the Atkins diet, which is high protein and low carbohydrate although it is thought that she now does the 'New' Atkins regime.

With France international Lloris sidelined by a knee injury, Dutchman Vorm will stand in at Turf Moor. The 31-year-old, signed from Swansea in the summer, had to watch on from the bench at Wembley against Chelsea in last month's League Cup final defeat, despite having featured in the earlier rounds. Michel Vorm is set to deputise in place of Hugo Lloris when Tottenham play Burnley on Sunday . Lloris sustained a knee injury in Tottenham's 4-3 victory over Leicester in the Premier League . Mauricio Pochettino has praised Vorm's attitude despite being behind Lloris in the pecking order . Pochettino, however, has every confidence Vorm can produced the required performance when thrown back into the action against the Clarets. 'Michel took it very well. I have no worries about him. He is a good professional and he is fine,' the Argentinian said. 'It is always it is difficult and it was the same with the other players who were left out. 'I was sorry for him, but also for the players who were on the bench or out of the squad. It is always difficult when you play a final and you have to choose the starting 11.' Pochettino has been impressed by Vorm's mentality, having left a regular starting place at Swansea to play back-up to Lloris. 'When I spoke with him about signing, he knew - I never lied to him. I told him our proposal and were very clear,' the Spurs boss said. Vorm (centre) played in all of the Capital One Cup games for Tottenham except the final .

{"id": "fba196dd72134e0daf5023016e05e77bfc845aab-4", "article": "Phoenix, Arizona (CNN)Nearly 12 million parents in the United States currently are raising kids on their own. When single parents face a devastating illness such as cancer, everyday needs like cleaning and cooking can become a struggle. Jody Farley-Berens saw the need firsthand, when her childhood friend faced that situation. \"Making ends meet is insurmountable,\" said Farley-Berens. \"There are so many doctors' appointments, copays, surgeries, prescriptions.  And then the inability to work -- any savings that there may have been is gone very quickly.\" She did all she could to help.  After her friend passed away, Farley-Berens helped start a nonprofit dedicated to assisting others in similar circumstances. Since 2006, Singleton Moms has provided practical, financial and emotional support to more than 300 parents in the Phoenix area. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 . Tiffany Montgomery, 48, was a newly single mom when she was diagnosed with stage-4 breast cancer. Farley-Berens' group pitched in to help, so Montgomery could spend more time with her daughter Ezri, now 10. \"When you can't really do much and you're looking at the dirt on the floor, it's one more level of stress,\" she said.  \"You have these people that come in, that don't know you, and 'You're going to help me with cleaning my house?'\" \"Singleton Moms has actually changed my whole outlook. They care about you, and they're demonstrating their love through their actions.\" I sat down with Farley-Berens to ask her about her work. Below is an edited version of our conversation. CNN: Tell me about the woman who inspired your work. Farley-Berens:  I grew up with a girl named Michelle Singleton who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 30.  She was a single mother of four children and I was a young mom with two kids. And it was scary. You just want to be there to watch them grow up. Paying the bills, cleaning her home, making dinner for her kids -- all of that became a real struggle. I wanted to make things as easy as possible for her. So when I would go to the store, I'd grab an extra Tide and extra toilet paper. When I would make my meals for my family, I would double it and bring a meal over to her house.  Once I helped with an electric bill.  I just tried to do those little things that I hoped would relieve her of some stress. About six months after she passed, we got to thinking she couldn't have been the only one. There were other people like her that needed help.  And that's how Singleton Moms was born. CNN: I'd imagine that many people haven't thought about the struggles of being a single parent with cancer.  How are you able to help? Farley-Berens: We focus on day-to-day support -- financial assistance, housecleaning, prepared meals, supplies for the home, kids' events. It's that old-fashioned mentality of neighbors helping neighbors. Who doesn't like a clean house that they didn't have to clean themselves? We have a team of volunteers that have all been background-checked and they sweep, mop, clean the bathrooms. We even have a couple of volunteers who go way above and beyond and will do laundry and fold clothes. And so, our parents can come home from chemo, sit on the couch and read a book with their child without having to worry about, \"Ugh, the bathroom needs to be cleaned.\"  It's just to allow them to focus on what's important, which is their health and their family. CNN: Is this work hard for you sometimes, on a personal level? Farley-Berens: About 80% of the parents we support are stage 4, which means that battling cancer is their full-time job. They will not go back to work and for the rest of their lives, they'll be in treatment. It's hard.  It's a rollercoaster.  I've had bouts when a certain mom has passed where I didn't get out of bed for two weeks. And I thought, \"Why am I doing this?\"  But then I come back and remember why. And so, while Michelle is and always will be our inspiration, there are now so many others that are just as inspirational. They're why I keep doing what I do. CNN: We should note that name of the organization is no longer entirely accurate. Farley-Berens: We're not just about moms -- we have dads, too! Not a lot, but if you are a single parent, you need the support.  They tend to even get a little special treatment.  Everybody's like, \"Oh, there's a dad here.\"  And so they give them lots of hugs and pay a lot of attention to them. CNN:  It's such a serious subject, but your group seems to have a very fun vibe. Farley-Berens: We're very social!  Once a month, all of our families come to pick up their supplies.  We do crafts with the kids, snacks and have a good time.  We like having any event because cancer sucks, and there's not a lot of happy that goes with that. But life does still go on, so it's really important that these families can just de-stress and have fun. No one can understand what they're going through like another single parent with cancer. So giving them the opportunity to meet and support each other is very powerful. Cancer can be so defeating.  It's an ugly word and it's a sad word.  And so, it's my hope that Singleton Moms can bring joy and say to cancer, \"You can't defeat us.  We are still going to be strong and we're going to celebrate life.  And you can't take that away from us.\" Want to get involved?

With no Martin Skrtel, Olivier Giroud will be licking his lips. Kolo Toure and Mamadou Sakho are both solid enough but they are nervous in possession and they will miss the experience and physicality of Skrtel. If Dejan Lovren is fit, I expect him to play, but if not, don\u2019t be surprised if Giroud gets on the scoresheet. The Frenchman is in excellent form this season but the only question mark against him was does he score enough in the big games? So far in this campaign, he has scored against Manchester United, City and Liverpool. He will want to continue that run on Saturday.

I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I have covered Arsenal games and wondered how Per Mertesacker does it. It always amazes me that teams don\u2019t try and get pacey players in and around him more often. He\u2019s never been blessed with speed and playing a high line can cause him problems, but he has a World Cup medal to his name, so he must be doing something right. His partner Laurent Koscielny is much more mobile, so a fit-again Daniel Sturridge as well as Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho will hope to exploit Mertesacker\u2019s side of the defence. Germany World Cup-winner Per Mertesacker (right) is expected line-up in defence for Arsenal . However, Mertesacker's lack of pace could be exposed if Daniel Sturridge (right) is fit to start for Liverpool . AARON RAMSEY vs JORDAN HENDERSON . This time last year if you asked people who they would rather have in their team, it would be Aaron Ramsey all day long. But Jordan Henderson has come so far it is now a 50-50 call. These are the midfield marathon men and whoever wins this battle in the engine room should end up on the winning side. Ramsey can grab a goal, and Liverpool will have to watch his runs into the box, but Henderson will press hard and make sure Ramsey and the likes of Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla have no room to breathe.

So, who are Cape Verde and why has this tiny island off the west coast of Africa suddenly become an international football force? Where are the Cape Verde Islands? Cape Verde is a group of islands 400 miles from Senegal off the west coast of Africa. Its population is around 500,000 and boasts both beautiful beaches and striking volcanic landscapes, making it a haven for tourism . Cape Verde is a picturesque island off the African coast with a population of just 500,000 people . Does it have any footballing tradition? More than you think. Manchester United winger Nani is from Cape Verde and could have played for them instead of Portugal. Celtic and Sweden legend Henrik Larsson's mum is from Cape Verde. Being a former Portuguese colony, most people support the big Lisbon clubs Benfica and Sporting, you see the club's scarves and banners hanging from cafes and bars . Sporting Lisbon ace Nani (centre) is from Cape Verde but decided to represent Portugal at national team level . Former Barcelona star Henrik Larsson could have played for Cape Verde as his mother was born on the island . Why the sudden success? Like a lot of African countries including Algeria and Ghana, Cape Verde decided to start recruiting players who grew up in Europe, mostly Portugal in their case, but were eligible for them through family ties. Around a quarter of the Cape Verde squad are European, although 14 of the 19 players used in Portugal were born on the island. They qualified for their first Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 and reached the quarter-finals, and qualified again this year. They are the smallest nation ever to play in the continental finals. Cape Verde were eliminated at the quarter-final stage of their first ever Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 . Who are the star players? Every member of the squad plays club football outside Cape Verde, mostly in Europe and particularly Portugal. Striker Heldon plays for Sporting Lisbon and midfield set-piece specialist Babanco is with Estoril. Odair Fortes, who scored their second goal against the Portuguese, plays in French football for Reims. Other members of the squad ply their trade from Romania, Angola, Cyprus, Hungary, Holland, Bulgaria and Mexico . Sporting Lisbon striker Heldon, currently on loan at\u00a0Cordoba, is one of Cape Verde's key players . What can Cape Verde offer visitors? Firstly, sunshine. The temperatures rarely dip below 21 degrees Celsius (70 F) even in the December and January winger months. The name of the main beach Boa Vista (beautiful view) says it all. It is beginning to become a big tourist destination, just a six-hour flight from the UK. Visitors are encouraged to sample the excellent local fish and admire the spectacular dunes and volcanic mountains. Boa Vista beach, pictured, is one of the main attractions on the small island of Cape Verde . Are they a flash-in-the-pan? The FIFA rankings would suggest not. Cape Verde currently stand 38th in the world, one place ahead of Scotland. Although they failed to make the knockout stages of this year's Africa Cup of Nations, they did return home unbeaten after three draws against Tunisia, Congo and former winners Zambia. Cape Verde celebrate during their 2-0 friendly victory over Portugal on Tuesday evening . What is the special relationship with Portugal? Portuguese explorers discovered the island in 1456 and it stayed a Portuguese colony until independence in 1975. But famine and lack of economic opportunity around the same time meant many young Cape Verde men were forced to go to Portugal to build new lives there. Now the country's football team is helping them re-establish their roots. The reason for Tuesday night's friendly in the first place was to raise money for the victims of a volcanic eruption on the Cape Verdean island of Fogo. And the only saving grace for Portugal...

Frenchman Henry scores his first by slotting the ball between the legs of Jerzey Dudek . Henry gestures to the Highbury crowd after scoring a hat-trick against Liverpool . Now Arsenal's first treble against Liverpool came from, you guessed it, Thierry Henry. The Frenchman, aided by a strike from fellow countryman Robert Pires, led the Gunners to a 4-2 victory at Highbury in April 2004. The fourth hat-trick of this fixture was scored by Peter Crouch in March 2007, when the big striker helped Liverpool to a 4-1 victory at Anfield.

Crouch (centre) is congratulated by Liverpool team-mates Jermaine Pennant (left) and Dirk Kuyt . Finally, the pick of the bunch is Andrey Arshavin's haul - because it was actually a quadruple! In a brilliant 4-4 draw at Anfield in April 2009, Arshavin scored all of Arsenal's goals and crowned one of the all-time great individual performances in Premier League history.

The Bees controlled the game for long periods after going ahead through Alex Pritchard's brilliant strike - but missed chances in the second half came back to haunt them when Bent grabbed his 10th goal for the Rams. Derby went into the game knowing they needed to win to keep their slim hopes of automatic promotion alive and Tom Ince twice went close in the opening seven minutes. Alex Pritchard celebrates his stunning strike with his Brentford team-mates, after putting his side ahead . Derby: Grant, Keogh, Albentosa, Forsyth, Warnock (Whitbread 78 mins), Russell (Dawkins 46), Bryson (Lingard 78), Hendrick, Ince, Bent, Martin . Subs not used:\u00a0Ward, Roos, Hanson, Thomas .

Goal:\u00a0Pritchard 21 . Booked: Tarkowski . Referee: Graham Scott . The on-loan Hull winger was caught by Toumani Diagouraga in the fifth minute and curled the 25-yard free-kick over the wall and just past David Button's left post with the goalkeeper desperately scrambling to get across. Button had to plunge to his right two minutes later when Ince curled a shot from the edge of the box but Brentford hit back in the 14th minute when Jota's header set up Moses Odubajo for a shot that Lee Grant pushed away. Grant was relieved to see a free-kick from Alan Judge whistle past his left post after Pritchard was tripped by Raul Albentosa just outside the area in the 22nd minute - but he was beaten by a quality goal six minutes later. Diagouraga tackled Jeff Hendrick deep in his own half and found Jonathan Douglas who quickly released Judge, before Pritchard went past Richard Keogh and Craig Bryson and bent a right foot shot from the edge of the box past the despairing dive of Grant. Pritchard again found space just outside the area but this time he shot straight at Grant before Ince ran down the left of Brentford's defence to drive in a low shot which Button saved diving to his left. Alan Judge strikes a free kick over the Derby wall, but it flies just over the crossbar . Brentford were good value for their half-time lead and they came close to increasing it in the 51st minute when Bryson's attempted clearance spun back to Andre Gray - but Albentosa deflected his shot wide. Gray had another chance four minutes later when Douglas played him in but fired wide from eight yards, then the home fans found their voice when sub Simon Dawkins played Bent in but Button raced off his line to make the save. There was a big let-off for Derby in the 68th minute when Jota pulled the ball back from the edge of the six-yard box to tee up Douglas - but his shot was cleared off the line by Craig Forsyth. Brentford had another chance in the 73rd minute when Stuart Dallas crossed to the back post, where Gray headed over at full stretch and the Rams nearly made them pay when Zak Whitbread flicked on a corner and Button made an instinctive save to push the ball behind. But Derby grabbed a goal they barely deserved in the second minute of stoppage time when Hendrick fired in a low shot and Bent pounced to stab home an equaliser that was tough on Brentford.

Kenny Jackett\u2019s team moved into sixth place in the Championship with a fourth successive victory after David Edwards, the substitute, headed home two minutes from the end of an unpredictable and thrilling game. Pre-match results had offered Wolves a prospective route into the play-off zone, with Brentford and Ipswich Town dropping points unexpectedly, and Kenny Jackett reflected the burgeoning confidence within Molineux by naming an unchanged starting line-up from the side that prevailed 2-1 at Nottingham Forest on Friday for a third successive victory. Wolves substitute David Edwards races away in celebration after scoring a late winner . Edwards is congratulated by his Wolves team-mates following his 88th-minute winner against Leeds .

With a day less to recover, Leeds had also been on a decent run before Saturday\u2019s 3-0 home defeat by Blackburn Rovers topped another distressing chapter in their tumultuous recent history. Neil Redfearn, the head coach, had said he would consider his future after this game at Wolves after his assistant Steve Thompson had been suspended without explanation. Although Massimon Cellini, Leeds\u2019 banned owner, has subsequently claimed Thomson had used abusive language towards sporting director Nicola Salerno, it was only another spanner in the works for this once-proud club who need stability more than anything. Still, it was Leeds who struck the first blow, courtesy of a poor defensive clearance from Kevin McDonald who, penned back towards his own corner flag by debutant Kalvin Phillips, attempted a loose clearance that cannoned off Richard Stearman, his own team-mate, for Charlie Taylor to sidefoot under Carl Ikeme. Even before the January arrival of Benik Afobe, now level with Harry Kane as the leading goalscorer in all four divisions, Wolves have happily relied on either and both of the Mali combination of Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko. It was the latter who earned Jackett\u2019s team the lead by half-time. Dicko equalised from the tightest of angles when a cross-shot from Afobe, all loping legs and dizzying stepovers, eluded Marco Silvestri. It still needed a cute finish as the former Wigan striker lifted his shot over Scott Wootton from the byline for his 12th goal of an increasingly impressive season. Alex Mowatt looks delighted after putting Leeds back on level terms by scoring his side's third goal . Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme  dives in vain as Mowatt makes it 3-3 before Edwards' late winner . Leeds attempted to disrupt Wolves\u2019 rhythm with some fiercely competitive tackling, Phillips receiving one caution for fouling McDonald then fortunate not to be dismissed for a foul that ripped holes in the former Sheffield United midfielder\u2019s sock. The home side started to put together the pieces of their flowing passing game as half-time approached however and, in stoppage time, Leeds conceded at what appeared to be the worst time. Their defence appeared to disappear as Sako played in Dicko who took his time before firing in off the near post. Wolves turned the screw at the start of the second half as Afobe joined in the goalscoring fun three minutes after the restart. The former Arsenal striker, who scored 19 times on loan for MK Dons in the first half of the season, attempted an audacious overhead kick from Jack Price\u2019s cross into the area. Sako kept play alive, dropping the ball back for Batth, whose shot hit Dicko but fell back for Afobe to smash in his tenth goal for Wolves. Leeds looked as if they might capitulate at this stage before Wolves offered them a lifeline back into the game in the 66th minute. Alex Mowatt\u2019s dink into the penalty area looked pretty harmless and a cry of \u2018leave it\u2019 could be heard from the press box, presumably from Ikeme, only for Batth to lunge and divert the ball past his own goalkeeper. Richard Stearman was the next guilty party in the Wolves defence as he gave the ball away cheaply to Mowatt who cut inside and from outside the penalty area curled home a superb equaliser into the top corner. Wolves do possess strength in depth however and in David Edwards they have a midfielder who not only works as hard as anyone in pressing the ball but also chips in with crucial goals. So it was that the substitute rose two minutes from time to head McDonald\u2019s telling cross into the top corner to wrap up the win that took Wolves into sixth place.

Now isn\u2019t that a relief? On Sunday afternoon, both sets of supporters will have the chance to suspend the depressing reality of their current plight. Over the course of their last six matches \u2014 12 in total \u2014 the pair have amassed a not-so-mighty six points. During that same period \u2014 18 hours of football, no less \u2014 they have scored four times between them, conceding 22 along the way. It is little wonder they have billed this one \u2018The Desperation Derby\u2019. Perhaps \u2018The Donkey Derby\u2019 would be more apt. John Carver issues instructions to his players during training on Friday ahead of Sunday's derby . Carver put his Newcastle players through their paces during the session at St James' Park . Dick Advocaat wraps up warm as he prepares his Sunderland side for Sunday's crunch clash . Sunderland are the country\u2019s most out-of-form side and, unless new boss Dick Advocaat can reverse what is a sorry slide towards the bottom three, they will be back in the Championship come August. Newcastle won\u2019t be, but therein lies the problem. It is job done on Tyneside. The Magpie mandate is survival and little more, a dispiriting acceptance of mediocrity which has permeated a squad in desperate need of overhaul, both in terms of quality and character. The same can be said of a Sunderland side who have won just four times all season. If it wasn\u2019t for the history and intensity of the rivalry, this would have all the appeal of The Dog and Duck versus The Red Lion. Perhaps that is being disrespectful to pub teams, however. But, amid all of the gloom, the stakes remain sky high, albeit for different reasons. For Sunderland, it is about survival. Forget their bid for a record-making five straight victories over the enemy. Forget, even, bragging rights. Carver is fighting to secure his future as Newcastle manager beyond the end of this season . Advocaat was all smiles as he attempts to steer Sunderland clear of Premier League relegation . With trips to Arsenal and Chelsea to sign off their dismal season, this is one of six winnable matches which will determine their fate. Advocaat knows as much and hinted on Friday that he is working on a six-game rescue plan. Their last six have yielded just two points and one goal. Should that sad sequence persist then it will end in a future-defining demotion to the second tier. For never has relegation come at such a cost given the fulsome flow of the Premier League cash-cow. For Newcastle head coach John Carver, it\u2019s about making a point. The outcome of this game will shape his future also. Lose, and the chances of him landing the job beyond the end of the season will take a serious hit. \u2018I have stopped thinking about getting the job on a permanent basis, I really have, because if I keep worrying about everything that\u2019s going on, if I keep worrying about everybody who has been linked with the job, then I won\u2019t be giving this my 100 per cent, so I don\u2019t even think about \u201cpermanent\u201d,\u2019 said Carver. \u2018In my eyes, I am permanent. In the contract I signed there was nothing about \u201cshort term\u201d, there was nothing about \u201cinterim\u201d. I am the permanent manager and that\u2019s my mindset on this, so I don\u2019t even think about the summer.\u2019 Newcastle are not in danger of relegation but their season has faded away in recent months . Jermain Defoe, who has scored twice since his return to England, trains with team-mates on Friday . Advocaat, meanwhile, will be gone come June, regardless of which division he leaves Sunderland in. To that end, his reputation is on the line. \u2018If I didn\u2019t think I could do it then I would have said \u201cno\u201d,\u2019 said the 67-year-old, who has never been relegated, as a player or manager. \u2018I need to give the players confidence. I need to be a little bit softer because of the position we\u2019re in, but if they don\u2019t do what I want then they won\u2019t play. \u2018The game against Aston Villa [4-0 home defeat] shows you that something is wrong. They will not play like that under me.\u2019 History is at least on Advocaat\u2019s side. By a quirk of footballing fate, his predecessors \u2014 Paolo di Canio and Gus Poyet \u2014 both won derbies in their second match in charge. \u2018The pressure is on then, yes?\u2019 laughed Advocaat. He may joke and dismiss such coincidence, but those victories both played a part in Sunderland avoiding relegation. Gabriel Obertan (left) closes in on Mehdi Abeid during Friday's training session at St James' Park . Tim Krul works on his handling as he prepares to keep Sunderland out in the Tyne-Weir derby on Sunday . And that is a recurring theme on Wearside \u2014 a tedious tale of an annual battle against the drop. At least that, however, offers some perverse excitement for supporters. Up the road at Newcastle, the club who returned profits of \u00a318.7million last week are in debt to a fanbase which, mystifyingly, still exceeds 50,000 on a fortnightly basis. Anger has made way for apathy at Gallowgate, for fans have accepted that, as long as Mike Ashley remains in power, their lucrative existence \u2014 at least that is for the owner \u2014 resides somewhere between 17th and 10th. For the Toon Army, it is \u2018The Derby of Disillusion\u2019. Indeed, many supporters resent their own club as much as they do their rivals across the river. Throw in Jack Colback returning to the Stadium of Light for the first time since his defection to Newcastle, Sunderland\u2019s Adam Johnson playing at home for the first time since his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl, as well as a ludicrous 4pm kick-off in the middle of a Bank Holiday weekend, and you feel that a potentially poisonous atmosphere awaits. But the good news is that form goes out of the window. We can only hope that much is true.", "candidate": "Sunderland host Newcastle United in the Premier League on Sunday.

The 84-year-old, who died on Friday, talked about his cancer and the treatment he was undergoing with typical candour. 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap,' Benaud told the\u00a0Nine Network\u00a0about growing up in Australia in the 1930s and 40s. 'I wish I had.\u00a0You live and learn as you go along.' The cricket commentary box legend talked about the radiation treatment he was receiving for his skin cancer. Scroll down for video . Skin cancer: Richie Benaud, pictured at the SCG in January 2013, revealed late last year that he had skin cancer and was receiving radiation treatment, admitting that 'as a kid we never ever wore a cap' but using the opportunity to advise all Australians to cover their heads . Marvellous: Richie Benaud, pictured in 1961 in Britain when he was captaining the Test series, admitted last year that he had never worn head gear as a young player because he had been influence by legendary all rounder Keith Miller, saying 'when I was a kid, you never ever wore a cap ... that's because Keith Miller never wore a cap' Benaud, who hadn't returned to his commentary job for the Nine Network following a car accident in October 2013 in which he suffered serious injuries, had looked increasingly frail and had lost weight. But he had been out walking with his beloved wife Daphne for 40 minutes every morning, in the hope that he could return to work. Benaud had been driving his beloved car - a 1963 Sunbeam Alpine - back from hitting practice golf balls at the Australian Golf Club in Sydney when he\u00a0lost control and hit a parked car and then a small brick fence. He was hospitalised with shoulder, spinal and chest injuries and a broken sternum. He was subsequently diagnosed with skin cancer and began treatment last year, revealing that doctors were pleased with his progress. He told reporters last November he was 'coping with it very well'. The cricket legend said he believed the cancers were caused by playing cricket in the sun without a hat or sunscreen. Long history behind the microphone: Richie Benaud looks on during the fifth test match between England and Australia in August 1989, wearing one of his trademark light-coloured jackets which were his signature along with his unique commentary . Fan favourite: Richie Benaud was such a legend as a cricet commentator in his trademark cream jacket that he inspired a legion of fans dressed up in Australian cricket fans dressed up and wearing silver wigs and and carrying foam microphones at the Ashes Test at the SCG in January 2014 . The voice of Australian cricket: Richie Benaud, pictured at The Oval during the September 2005 Ashes Test, was one of Australian sport's great personalities and the boss of the commentary box at Test matches in Australia and Britain . Richie Benaud, pictured with Worcestor captain Don Kenyon before an Australia v Worcester match in England, captained Australia and played 63 Test matches in the late 1950s and the early 1960s, helping to restore the country's reputation as a cricketing nation . What a catch: Richie Benaud, pictured with his beloved wife, Daphne, at  Randwick racecourse in 2007, said that following a serious car crash and then treatment for skin cancer he and Daphne had been walking for '40 minutes a day' to ease him back to good health in the hope he could return to the commentary box . The former Australian test cricketer seized on the opportunity to encourage Australians to protect themselves from the sun. 'I recommend to everyone they wear protection on their heads,' he said.\u00a0'Eighty-four-year-olds don't seem to mend as well as they used to.' He said he was still recovering from the car accident injuries which included two fractured vertebrae. However, he expressed the belief he would make a return to cover the fourth Test against India at the SCG in Sydney, and had been out walking with his beloved wife Daphne every morning in an effort to regain his health.

'Progress is slow,' he said. 'I've been doing a lot of walking. 'We are out every morning, doing 40-minute walks every morning and it's showing beneficial effects.' Without the information on skin cancer danger now available during his playing days, Benaud revealed he was influenced by the example of great all rounder Keith Miller. 'When I was a kid, you never ever wore a cap - not a flash one,' Benaud said. 'That's because Keith Miller never wore a cap. Arthur Morris did when he went out to bat.

Boro boss Aitor Karanka said before the game that his team had to win all four of their remaining matches to finish in the top two of a claustrophobic Championship. And thanks to Blues loanee Bamford \u2013 creator of one for Jelle Vossen and scorer of the other - the Teessiders remain on course for what would be a deserved return to the top division. Patrick Bamford (second right) scored Middlesbrough's second goal as they beat Wolves on Tuesday night . Middlesbrough (4-2-3-1): Konstantopoulos; Kalas, Woodgate (Omeruo 62), Gibson, Friend; Clayton, Forshaw; Adomah (Amorebieta 80), Tomlin, Bamford; Vossen (Nsue 74).

Subs not used:\u00a0Kuszczak, Henry, Doyle, Ebanks-Landell. Booked: Stearman, Batth, Sako, Edwards. Goal: Sako 63. Referee:\u00a0Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire). Attendance:\u00a020,520. Man of the Match: Patrick Bamford. Boro were relegated in 2009 and even the play-offs have been beyond them in the years since. This maximum at least guaranteed post-season participation, but they will want to avoid that scenario. And with the likes of Bamford in this kind of form they have every chance of going up automatically. Friday\u2019s trip to Norwich, however, will go a long way to determining their fate in that respect. Karanka said: \u2018We want more than the play-offs and the players showed that here. They were amazing in the first half. But this game demanded a lot of us mentally. We have to be ready for Norwich now, it is another huge game.\u2019 Bamford, with 17, has now scored more league goals in one season than any other Boro player has achieved in the last 25 years. The 21-year-old makes no secret of his desire to one day return to Chelsea and challenge for a starting jersey. Karanka, though, could well be using his friendship with Jose Mourinho to secure another loan stay should they join the West Londoners in the Premier League. \u2018For me, he is the best young player in the league. He is scoring goals and is showing he is mature, not just on the pitch but also in the changing-room,\u2019 added the former Real Madrid assistant. Boro were good value for this win \u2013 Wolves boss Kenny Jackett called them \u2018ruthless\u2019 - and they were ahead inside three minutes. Adam Clayton loaded a ball forward from deep and Bamford gave chase. His presence was enough to unsettle dithering centre-back Richard Stearman and the forward stole in before squaring for the unmarked Vossen who rolled home for his eighth of the season. Bamford celebrates with Jelle Vossen after he teed up the Belgian for Boro's early opener . The goal owed everything to Bamford\u2019s endeavour and he soon had one of his own on 11 minutes. Albert Adomah fed over-lapping right-back Tomas Kalas and he drove into the area before locating the feet of his Chelsea team-mate. Bamford took one touch to fashion a yard for the shot before swivelling and smashing beyond Carl Ikeme from eight yards. It was a classy finish and added to the dossier of evidence which suggests there is a first-team future at Stamford Bridge. Bamford neatly finishes Boro's second to put the home side in cruise control early in the first half . Bamford is mobbed by his team-mates including former England international Jonathan Woodgate (left) Boro continued to pour forward and Adomah came within a stroke of paint of netting a late goal-of-the-season contender. Weaving between two visiting shirts 25 yards from goal, the Ghanaian unleashed a rising drive which cracked the underside of Ikeme\u2019s crossbar. As if Wolves\u2019 task wasn\u2019t stiff enough, they should have been reduced to 10 men when Stearman hauled down Bamford as he skipped clear on goal. That the offence occurred some 40 yards out perhaps spared him red. Boro now have three matches to play as they chase automatic promotion to the Premier League . Middlesbrough . April 17: Norwich (A), April 25: Fulham (A), May 2: Brighton (H). Wolves . April 18: Ipswich (H), April 25: Wigan (A), May 2: Millwall (H). The front-running Kalas wasn\u2019t letting up with his offensive intent and another forward burst presented a chance for Vossen, the Belgian prodding over from 12 yards moments after the restart for the second half. Wolves had offered little at the other end of the park but a swift break brought them to within one on 53 minutes. Dave Edwards galloped through the middle and slipped a pass to Sako who smashed between Konstantopoulos and his near post. And they should have been level when Rajiv van La Parra steamed onto Scott Golbourne\u2019s deep centre and rattled the crossbar with a first-time volley. Boro, though, held on.

{"id": "63d1a85de1f620ab88245cc29d1e20493c18c12e-1", "article": "All eyes were again on Jimmy Anderson as England on Thursday night began their push for victory here but instead the limelight was seized by Chris Jordan with his second stunning catch of the first Test. A day that featured a fourth Test century in only his ninth match for Gary Ballance ended with the leader of England\u2019s attack still waiting for the wicket that will bring him level with Sir Ian Botham\u2019s Test record. So well did Ballance and England bat that Alastair Cook was able to set West Indies a target of 438 in just over four sessions that would even surpass their own world record successful Test chase. Yet so solidly did West Indies begin their attempt to emerge unscathed from this first of three Tests that it became pertinent to remember that record was set in none other than Antigua and featured a century by a certain Shiv Chanderpaul. It remains highly unlikely that West Indies will today surpass the 418 for seven they made to defeat Australia at the old St John\u2019s Rec 12 years ago. Cook, though, will be grateful for the athleticism of Jordan and the off-spin of Joe Root for the wicket that means England remain firm favourites to secure today what would be a highly valuable victory for them. When West Indies grafted their way to 90 for one on this fourth day it was possible to believe that they would at least be able to escape with a draw from this match and head to Grenada next week still all square. Yet When Jordan dived to his right at wide slip and grasped the chance offered by Darren Bravo\u2019s flailing bat in Root\u2019s second over a second West Indian wicket had fallen and England ended the day with a spring in their step. They still have much to do and all results remain possible but England will be much the happier with West Indies finishing on 98 for two, still a massive 340 short of recreating Antiguan Test history. For Anderson, however, there was just more frustration as he could not strike a blow in the seven overs he has so far bowled in the second innings. Botham remains in the wings, with a nice bottle of red at the ready, to congratulate Anderson if and when the big moment comes today. England timed both the pace of their batting and their declaration to perfection, scoring quickly enough to set West Indies that world record breaking target and giving themselves 130 overs to bowl them out. And at the centre of their batting effort was Ballance who has made a start to his Test career that can genuinely be described as great. Darren Bravo nicks Joe Root's delivery as Chris Jordan gets ready to pounce . Bravo can only watch on as Jordan makes a stunning dive to seize the loose ball . Jordan shows tremendous reflexes to cling on to dismiss the West Indies batsman . Gary Ballance plays a shot during day four of England's first Test against West Indies on Thursday . Ballance plays a sweeping shot during his impressive innings at the\u00a0Sir Vivian Richards Stadium . Ballance celebrates bringing up his century following his superb batting display in Antigua . Joe Root formed a solid partnership with Ballance and made big inroads against the home side . Root salutes the stands after he brought up his half century earlier in the day . Jos Buttler also impressed for Peter Moores' side with an unbeaten 59 off 56 balls . It is extraordinary, really, that Ballance should have been perceived to be under any sort of pressure going into the second innings of this first Test. Yes, he had a poor World Cup after being thrown into the England team with little preparation ahead of their opening match against Australia. And, yes, Ballance looked tentative in the first innings here at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium, pushing at a ball with hard hands he could have left alone. Yet memories are short these days and it should be remembered that Ballance had an extraordinary summer last year having been asked to bat in a position at No 3 he was unaccustomed to by coach Peter Moores. This was the Ballance of last season, the white shirt seemingly a much better fit than the blue of limited-overs cricket, and he is quite simply a run machine in the ultimate form of the game. Root was furious with himself when he again got an inside edge to be bowled when a century was there for the taking but his partnership of 114 with Ballance came at a crucial time for England with West Indies still in the hunt. It says everything about Ballance\u2019s 122 that the only time he looked in trouble was when Jos Buttler hit Sulieman Benn straight back at him and struck his batting partner a nasty blow on the elbow. Other than that it was pretty much plain sailing for England, with Jos Buttler also returning to form with an unbeaten 59 off 56 balls. Stuart Broad (centre) celebrates with his England team-mates after taking the wicket of\u00a0Kraigg Brathwaite . Root (right) gets the plaudits from his team-mates after he took the wicket of Bravo late on day four . The openers, of course, are much more of an issue but a win here on Friday would buy Cook a bit of time for both him and Jonathan Trott to get things right in Grenada next week and Barbados in the final Test. With Anderson in the form that saw him take only two of the four wickets he needed at the start of this Test to surpass Botham\u2019s tally of 383 in the first innings it was left to Stuart Broad to strike the first blow for England. An absolute brute of a delivery saw Kraigg Braithwaite fending to short leg and Broad quickly pointing to the dressing room to salute the role that bowling coach Ottis Gibson, who knows West Indies inside out having been their coach until earlier this year, played in the dismissal. James Anderson unsuccessfully appeals for the wicket of Bravo earlier in the contest . He is one of the best slip fielders England have found in years but Jordan will be annoyed he could not pouch another chance offered by Devon Smith before the close. Smith lived to fight another day on 59 and he too was in West Indies\u2019 side that famous day in 2003 when history was made. If he is part of history again then it will have been an extraordinary last day. Any hopes of a West Indies collapse quickly faded and all was quiet until Jordan\u2019s intervention to replicate his similar diving effort in the first innings. The West Indies side await a decision from the third empire on the fourth day of action in the Caribbean . He is clearly one of the best slip fielders England have found in years but Jordan will be annoyed that he could not get a hand to another sharp chance offered by Devon Smith off Root before the close. Smith lives to fight another day on 59 and it should be pointed out that he too was in West Indies side that famous day in 2003 when history was made on this island.

{"id": "476469ad322b867bebce7523324d060e97092a30-1", "article": "(CNN)I don't always talk about news events with my daughters, but there was something about the story of ESPN reporter Britt McHenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up. One of the main things I preach to my girls, ages 7 and 9, is the importance of respecting other people, no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish. It's something that my husband and I just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the President of the United States. Let me say right here that I have lost my cool from time to time, whether it's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant. In those cases, when I feel like I'm going to pop, I keep saying, \"This is unacceptable, This is unacceptable,\" and either hang up in disgust or storm off. (Not perfect ways of handling these incidents, but at no time would I ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations.) Some of McHenry's comments, such as how she's \"on television,\" imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she, by dint of her career, education and income, is better than people who don't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities. McHenry showed that she either forgot those \"golden rule\" lessons from childhood or that she hasn't really lived her life with that mantra. McHenry has since apologized on Twitter, saying she said \"some insulting and regrettable things,\" and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in Virginia,  she should \"always choose to be respectful and take the high road.\" But it's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker. \"I see this Britt McHenry video, and think: it's not just about how a celebrity shouldn't act in public, it's how all of us shouldn't act,\" wrote \"Cait\" on Twitter. Said \"Shannon,\" also on Twittter, \"I had no idea who Britt McHenry was before but ... now I know she's the kind of woman I hope I've taught my daughters not to be.\" \"Her language and disdain brings shame on her, her profession, and her employer. People don't all of sudden have such a vile tirade. This comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors. Let's let her be an example to others,\" wrote C Cooper on a Change.org petition asking McHenry's employers to fire her. The McHenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her. This morning, I told her McHenry was suspended for a week by ESPN, and that led to another conversation. My kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to \"treat other people the way you would want them to treat you\" even in uncomfortable moments. Celebrity apologies: The good, bad and uncomfortable . So, Britt McHenry, check out these examples of how the rich, famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity. After British journalist Katie Hopkins seriously fat-shamed pop music star Kelly Clarkson, saying a host of insulting things about the singer's weight, Clarkson won praise for her graceful response. \"That's because she doesn't know me. I'm awesome. It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think,\" she said. A college baseball player gets suspended for calling Little League baseball phenom Mo'ne Davis a \"slut.\" Her response? She emailed Bloomsburg University asking that the college reinstate him. \"Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance,\" Davis, the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in Little League World Series history, told ESPN. \"... I know right now he's really hurt and I know how hard he worked to get where he is. I mean, I was pretty hurt on my part but I know he's hurting even more.\" When an Argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to Pope Francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country's president ahead of the general election in October and possibly influencing the outcome, what did the Pope do? Well, he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call. Wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation! The pope appears to have been more than graceful, because after the conversation, the journalist pledged to learn how to pray. When Queen Bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip-synching the national anthem in honor of President Obama's inauguration in 2013, she didn't come out swinging. Instead, she admitted to singing along with her \"pre-recorded track\" at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring, a cappella rendition of the national anthem. Finally, Reese Witherspoon may be the closest example for McHenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode. When Witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence, the Academy Award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as, \"Do you know who I am?\" and \"You're about to find out who I am.\" She ultimately issued an apologetic statement, and then went on morning television to apologize some more. \"We went out to dinner in Atlanta, and we had one too many glasses of wine, and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not,\" she said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"It's completely unacceptable, and we are so sorry and embarrassed. We know better, and we shouldn't have done that.\" And, she added, \"When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car. I learned that for sure,\" she told the GMA host . Now, did McHenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry, you never berate them for their weight, job, appearance and income? Let's hope so. Can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect?

Don\u2019t be caught out by this impressive run of form and think everything is in place for a crack at the title next year. It is not uncommon to see Arsenal finish a season with a string of good results. Usually they rattle out a sequence of wins just in time to preserve their place in the top four but too late to affect the destiny of the Barclays Premier League. The same thing has happened this year. Chelsea were relentless from the first whistle and have had the title race firmly under control since before Christmas. Arsenal players celebrate after their extra-time winner against Reading in the FA Cup semi-finals last week . Alexis Sanchez jumps in the air and celebrates wildly after his second goal for Arsenal at Wembley . With a 10-point advantage, even if Jose Mourinho loses to Arsene Wenger for the first time on Sunday it won\u2019t stop his side becoming champions. Next year, though, Chelsea won\u2019t have it all their own way and no team is better placed than Arsenal to dislodge them. There is a different feel to their form and performances this time around and Wenger said recently he could \u2018smell\u2019 something happening. You just hope, however, Wenger and Arsenal\u2019s board don\u2019t get fooled into thinking they have got all the tools they need at their disposal. This is not the time to be complacent. This is the summer when Arsenal must go for it and make the big additions that will stop them being nearly-men. That is exactly what Chelsea did 12 months ago. After finishing behind Manchester City and Liverpool, Mourinho didn\u2019t mess around. In came Diego Costa, who had spearheaded Atletico Madrid\u2019s La Liga success, and a World Cup winner in Cesc Fabregas. They meant business. The money was big but the quality was proven and, after they were unveiled, everyone began tipping Chelsea for the title. We might be doing the same with Arsenal come August if Wenger, who has been criticised for spending Arsenal\u2019s money like it\u2019s his own, is similarly ambitious. Arsenal, it should be stressed, are not in need of major surgery and the spine of their team is now much stronger than at any point last season, when they only just held off Everton\u2019s challenge to finish fourth. But there is still room for improvement. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger talks to his players ahead of extra time at Wembley last Saturday . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho looks in fine form during a press conference on Friday . Results have been impressive since David Ospina replaced Wojciech Szczesny, who had failed to show the required consistency. Ospina has played 12 Premier League games; Arsenal have won 11 and he has kept six clean sheets, but Wenger still needs to buy a new No 1 if they are to be title challengers. Petr Cech would be an ideal candidate to come in. Laurent Koscielny has steadied things in defence, with Arsenal winning 15 of the 18 games he\u2019s played since January 1 but, to progress, Wenger needs another top centre back. Gabriel Paulista arrived in the New Year but it seems it was to provide cover for Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Francis Coquelin has added bite to the midfield, but would Arsenal have enough to challenge next season if Coquelin is their anchor and Mikel Arteta is his back up? No. Why doesn\u2019t he go for Paul Pogba, who looks set to leave Juventus? Wenger spent \u00a342m on Mesut Ozil, so why not spend the same and more on Pogba. If they needed to sign Ozil two years ago, their need to sign Pogba this summer is even greater. Diego Godin of Atletico Madrid is 29 and at the peak of his powers. He would be ideal at the heart of the defence. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina pictured during a training session at London Colney last week . Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech warms up before Saturday's Premier League clash against Manchester United . Olivier Giroud, meanwhile, has provided a focal point up front. I like Giroud. He is an under-rated striker and, had he not missed three months with a broken ankle, his tally would be more than 14; he averages a goal every 101.93 minutes, the second best rate in the Premier League. Giroud is one of a number of good options Wenger has up front. Alexis Sanchez has been brilliant, while Danny Welbeck has played his part, but that should not stop Wenger looking to improve on what he has got. If a forward with the class of players he has had before, such as Thierry Henry or Nicolas Anelka, comes on the market, Wenger would have to move for him. Imagine what Luis Suarez, Sergio Aguero or Karim Benzema could do for Arsenal? I\u2019m not saying Arsenal are getting to the levels of \u2018The Invincibles\u2019 but their form has me thinking they are getting closer. The 2-0 win at Manchester City in January could be a turning point. They made themselves difficult to beat rather than being open. Hopefully we will see more of this. Arsenal's French striker Olivier Giroud looks forward as he advances with the ball at Wembley . Danny Welbeck (left) looks to evade the challenge of Reading's Hal Robson-Kanu (centre) and Alex Pearce . Of course it has been frustrating that they have not challenged for the title since last winning it 11 years ago, and Wenger has not had a smooth ride. Fans turned on him after they lost at Stoke \u2014 and after the Champions League defeat to Monaco \u2014 leading to talk about Jurgen Klopp coming in. But some perspective is needed. Wenger has done a good job keeping Arsenal consistently in the top four \u2014 all their rivals have dropped out at some point in between \u2014 and by the end of next month, they could have won back-to-back FA Cups. How could you then get rid of Wenger? So one question would need asking: what are they waiting for? Both Manchester clubs will spend in the summer, but both those clubs have got far more problems to fix. City\u2019s squad is old and needs big investment, while United will have the complication of being back in Europe. Wenger, then, could use the next window to call it on. The message it would send out to his players, fans and, most significantly, their rivals would be huge. It would let everyone know they were launching an all-out assault on the title. They would have to be taken seriously. Beating Chelsea on Sunday won\u2019t alter things in the short term, but it will offer belief that Arsenal can challenge next season. What they do in the window will determine how big a statement they can make. Finding some special players could transform them. Borussia Dortmund head coach Jurgen Klopp celebrates after beating SC Paderborn last weekend . Wenger applauds the Arsenal fans after his side booked their place in the FA Cup final . Big guns missed out on a Fab freebie . Full marks to Aston Villa. They are a side rejuvenated by Tim Sherwood and absolutely deserved to beat Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final. Jack Grealish understandably attracted most of the headlines for his outstanding performance but the role Fabian Delph played was just as important; his aggression, energy and left foot gives Villa balance in their midfield. Liverpool couldn\u2019t cope with his aggression. Earlier this season, Delph was lauded for committing his future to Villa even when their position in the Barclays Premier League was threatened. He signed a four-year deal, which showed his character could never be called into question. What can be called into question, however, is the wisdom of some other clubs in the Premier League. Fabian Delph (right) celebrates after scoring for Aston Villa against Liverpool in the FA Cup semis . Delph, do not forget, was set to be out of contract this summer and a number of sides at the top of the table had their chance to sign a young England international for free. No doubt these same clubs will go out when the window opens and bring in at least one foreign midfielder, to go with the ones they signed last summer, and soon enough we will hear at some point next season that we don\u2019t have enough English players playing for top sides competing in Europe. There will then be complaints from clubs saying it is impossible to buy English players because there is such a premium on them and they will argue that is why they are forced to look abroad for new signings. The Delph situation shows that sometimes such an argument is nonsense. He is now Villa\u2019s captain and has been their best player for the last 18 months. His progress has been so impressive he is now a regular in the England squad and if he can add more goals to his game \u2014 like the one he scored against Liverpool \u2014 he could reach a very high level. Delph slots the ball past Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in Villa's 2-1 victory at Wembley . If Delph does maintain his improvement, inevitably clubs will come looking at him. But if they want him, it will cost. For reasons only they know, they let slip a chance to get something good for nothing. Their loss is most certainly Villa\u2019s gain.", "candidate": "Chelsea are 10 points clear at the top of the Premier League table.

I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won't consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia . Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. \"Marijuana...?\" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word. But just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said, \"I am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing.\" I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't. Instead, she added, \"You probably helped a lot of people who were suffering.\" I don't think we had ever had a conversation like that one. At that moment, I saw a revolution that can bring you to tears. The word revolution, comes from the Latin revolutio, to \"turn around.\" I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana. Hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic. Even patients I spoke to were reluctant to share their stories. It can be tricky, I learned, to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology. When we put the first \"Weed\" documentary on television in August 2013, I didn't know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation. Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care. Is weed legal in your state? Just two years later, in \"Weed 3,\" we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing. You will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD. You will meet patients such as Sean Kiernan, an accomplished investment banker, and Amelia Taylor, a stay-at-home mom. They are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution -- smart, successful and suffering -- unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat PTSD can be worse than the underlying disorder itself. Sean Kiernan nearly died, trying to get better. You will see what weed really does to your brain, in crystal clear images. This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States. This is what a revolution looks like. Your medical marijuana questions answered . When \"Weed 2: Cannabis Madness\" aired in March 2014, Boston researcher Rick Doblin believed the right people were watching. Just four days later, Doblin received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study. The federal farm where Doblin would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi. In anticipation of a scientific revolution, the production of research-grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year. Make no mistake, we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen. It was the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that spearheaded the research into a cure for AIDS, as well as stopping the spread of West Nile Virus. They were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox. Other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project, the BRAIN initiative and the Precision Medicine Initiative. There are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs, and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment. 10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact . There is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults, including treatment for cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's, to name a few. With regard to pain alone, marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses, which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country. As I sat across from Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), I knew something extraordinary was happening. They were reciting the story of Charlotte Figi and countless other children. They were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations. They were extolling the potential virtues of the plant, and all of that was before the interview even started. There was an impatience about them, and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform. They want marijuana to be rescheduled. They want it now. They want doctors to be able to prescribe it at VA hospitals all over the country. They want it now. They want research dollars freed up to study the plant. They want it now. They want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world, including the citizens of the United States, have known for a long time: Marijuana is a medicine, that should be studied and treated like any other medicine. And they want all of it now. I spent much of our interview challenging them. I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time. I reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them. I challenged them every step of the way. \"This time will be different,\" Booker confidently told me as he walked out of the room. Is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol? I know how easy it is do nothing because I did nothing for too long. Take a good look at the data, educate yourself and talk to the patients, who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant. Journalists shouldn't take a position. It makes sense. Objectivity is king. But, at some point, open questions do get answered. At some point, contentious issues do get resolved. At some point, common sense prevails. So, here it is: We should legalize medical marijuana. We should do it nationally. And, we should do it now. 9 things to know about legal pot .", "candidate": "CNN's John Sutter says he sees signs of a medical marijuana revolution everywhere.

So George Lucas is retaliating in a way that only the cream of Hollywood could - by building the largest affordable housing development in the area. The complex of affordable housing, funded and designed by the Star Wars director, would provide homes to 224 low-income families. And there's very little his fellow Bay Area residents can do about it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Making waves: George Lucas has unveiled plans to build an affordable housing complex on the plot of land in Lucas Valley, Bay Area, which his neighbors are determined to leave untouched . Lucas dropped plans for a Lucasfilm Ltd studio complex on Lucas Valley Road in 2012. Citing opposition from neighbors, a spokesman said they did not want to be seen as an 'evil empire'. But it seems the award-winning director is determined to do something with the 1,039 acres of land on his Grady Ranch estate in Marin County, California. The project, submitted for planning on Wednesday, would span 52 acres and cost around $200m. Just a few meters from his own Skywalker Ranch, the community would consist of two complexes. One would contain 120 two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes for low-income families. The other would be for pensioners: a four-story building with 104 one-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments. Because Lucas proposes to fund the project himself, his lawyers say he has the right to select who lives there. However, his representatives insist the project is not a form of retaliation. 'He said \"we've got enough millionaires here. What we need is some houses for regular working people\",' his lawyer Gary Giacomini told CBS. Scrapped: This was a rendering of the film studio that Lucas planned to build on the estate but was overruled . Idyllic: The 224-home community would be built in this idyllic spot of California for low-income families . Marin County Supervisor Steve Kinsey told the station: 'George Lucas said, \"if I\u2019m not going to do what I wanted to do there, what can I do that would be really beneficial to this community?\"' It is not the first time Lucas has courted controversy. In November 2014, residents of Chicago filed a lawsuit against Lucas' plans to build a museum along the shore of Lake Michigan. The case was a major blow to the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, a shrine his collection of art and movie memorabilia, after negotiations over a waterfront site fell through with San Francisco.", "candidate": "Star Wars director wants to build 224 homes for low-income families.

{"id": "0416271ba28bcdcfe08b12d068b23a1055dd8462-1", "article": "When Floyd Mayweather posted a picture of a signed contract for his $300 million mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao two months ago, there was a collective sigh of relief. After more than five years of wrangling and bickering, the richest fight in boxing history was finally set for May 2 in Las Vegas. But with 11 days to go until the two protagonists are due to touch gloves, not a single person has a ticket in their hands. Floyd Mayweather fights Manny Pacquiao next weekend but officially, no tickets are on sale . That's not to say that nobody has bought one; SeatGeek, which claims to be the world's largest event ticket search engine, is selling briefs for up to $30,000 (\u00a320,000). These are known as 'spec tickets' which the sellers don't have but expect to get before the fight. The venue for the bout, the 16,500-capacity MGM Grand Arena has the following message on its website: . 'Details on ticket sales coming soon! Please be aware that tickets for the May 2, 2015, Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight are not yet available for purchase. 'Buyers should use extra caution when purchasing alleged tickets from unofficial sources, for fraudulent or counterfeit tickets will not be accepted.' So why the delay? Initially, Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum said tickets would be on sale in the first week of April but that less than 1,000 - priced between $1,500 and $7,500 - were expected to be made available to the public. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum (left) has blamed Mayweather's side for the lack of tickets . Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, claimed they would be on sale last week . The rest would be distributed by the fighters, promoters, television networks Showtime and HBO and the MGM Grand. But last week, SeatGeek analyst Connor Gregoire said: 'It's bizarre, normally there's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight.\u00a0To our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now.' Gregoire went on to say that only a dozen tickets had been sold through the website at an average price of $8,000 (\u00a35,400). Another ticketing site, StubHub, are yet to put any tickets on sale. Spokesperson Alison Salcedo said: 'There's still so much up in the air for this fight that we're not allowing spec sales. We're not willing to take that risk now.' As far as Arum is concerned, the blame lies squarely on Mayweather's side. 'All of this is on the MGM (Grand), I mean, if you think that the MGM is calling the shots here, you're totally mistaken. It's the man behind the curtain,' he told Boxing Scene, alluding to Mayweather's adviser Al Haymon. Mayweather trains with his uncle Roger during a media workout in Las Vegas last week . Pacquiao is taken on the pads by trainer Freddie Roach in front of the watching media . 'This is going to the governor's office. This is an absolute disgrace, what's happening. 'What do you want from me? It's not on us.' Pacquiao's manager Michael Koncz has also expressed his frustration. He said: 'It's a real mess right now. I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the holdup? I'm more than a little upset they're not for sale to the public.' In the opposite corner, Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe has claimed Arum was lashing out because he is not the lead promoter in the fight. 'Every time he doesn't get his way, he goes running to the press misrepresenting the facts,' he said. 'The bottom line is this: Bob cannot stomach the fact that he is not the lead promoter. Reality has set in, and this is typical Bob. My responsibility is to ensure every deal is done properly, to benefit the fighters and the event.' It remains to be seen who will make up the 16,500-capacity crowd at the MGM Grand . Ellerbe did say that tickets would be on sale last week but there is no sign of an end to the stalemate. Nor is there any indication of when the reported 50,000 closed-circuit seats at MGM properties - priced at around $150 (\u00a3100) - in Las Vegas will be available to purchase. The hotel's website says simply: 'Please check back for closed-circuit viewing availability at other MGM Resorts Properties.' In fact, the only ticket you can buy is for the weigh-in. Priced at $10, the unusual step has been taken in an effort to control the expected huge crowd but all proceeds will go to charity with each fighter nominating their choice. With UFC star Ronda Rousey guaranteed the only free ticket from Arum and Amir Khan set to be ringside next Saturday as he eyes a future fight against either man, there will at least be a crowd of sorts.

He understood the horror of it instantly. He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away, as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans. His face was scrunched against the grass, distorted in a mask of despair. Reading, still struggling to avoid relegation to League One, had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra-time in this FA Cup semi-final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1-1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now. There had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici. He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it. It was football at its most cruel. In years to come, it will be the enduring image of this game. Alexis Sanchez's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe . The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game .

Subs not used: Wilshere, Ospina,  Monreal, Flamini. Goals: Sanchez 39, 106 . When the final whistle confirmed that it would be Arsenal who will face either Liverpool or Aston Villa here at the end of next month, Federici, 30, put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch, his thoughts fixed on some form of escape, some search for sanctuary. The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, tried to console him but he was inconsolable. As he disappeared down the tunnel, he hung his head and wept. Sure, the bigger picture was that Arsenal now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession. The bigger picture is that this time, their success in the FA Cup seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season\u2019s Cup final victory over Hull. But above all, this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend. \u2018I am happy we are through,\u2019 said Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. \u2018But I thought Federici was terrific today. He had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him. He was the best player on the pitch. I really feel for him \u2014 I have been there, done that.\u2019 Clarke did his best to ease Federici\u2019s pain, too. \u2018This is the life of a goalkeeper,\u2019 said the Reading boss. \u2018And Adam is a top goalkeeper. There\u2019s every chance he\u2019ll be Reading\u2019s player of the season this year. His performances in the Championship have been crucial. \u2018We stick by him. I understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is. Adam is a strong character as well. He\u2019ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night when we play Birmingham I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be as good as he always is.\u2019 Clarke also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team. He had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed Arsenal all the way. There were times when it seemed Arsene Wenger\u2019s team, who had been pegged back by the Championship strugglers in normal time, might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade. The match became a test of Arsenal\u2019s fortitude as well as their class. In former years, they might have buckled.

They had nearly taken an early lead when Per Mertesacker rose to meet a corner at the near post and Federici had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line. Later, he produced a stunning one-handed stop to keep out a header from Gabriel. Reading held firm but Arsenal started to exert more and more pressure. Mesut Ozil, in particular, was a delight to watch in possession. There are increasing signs that the German is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled Reading with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes. Seven minutes before the interval, Arsenal broke the stalemate. It was Ozil, inevitably, who was the inspiration. He collected the ball midway inside the Reading half, took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to Sanchez in the box. Sanchez did the rest, although the rest was not simple. He controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal, turned and committed Garath McCleary by shaping to shoot. Then, with time, the Chilean forward prodded the ball past Federici and wheeled away to celebrate. Gabriel (right), a replacement for Per Mertesacker, powers a header at goal shortly after Reading had scored .

Reading\u2019s threat had been negligible. But they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal, they forced an equalizer. Pavel Pogrebnyak must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline. The ball drifted over Kieran Gibbs\u2019 head and as Szczesny scrambled across his line, McCleary volleyed the ball back across him. Szczesny got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line. Suddenly, Reading wanted more. Jamie Mackie clipped a lovely chip into the path of Danny Williams on the edge of the box. It fell to him nicely but Williams sliced his volley wildly wide. The game was harum-scarum now. Reading sensed an upset. Mackie urged the fans on and they roared back. But six minutes from the end of normal time, Reading escaped when Aaron Ramsey missed an open goal, crashing a left-foot shot against the post. Ramsey held his head in his hands.

{"id": "2c7fe30f77843a79b06515422e92f93caf6b5cf6-1", "article": "This was tricky for Steve Cotterill. He did not want to do Bristol City down but at the same time felt the truth ought to be laid bare. The eight-second pause was revealing in its length as a delicate topic reared its head. Where exactly would this club \u2014 now on the brink of the Championship \u2014 be without their billionaire owner Steve Lansdown? Cotterill looked down at his feet, searching for the right answer. \u2018I don\u2019t quite know,\u2019 he said, head shaking. It isn\u2019t worth thinking about. He is aware that they\u2019d be nowhere near a win away from League One promotion, potentially ending the season as champions and enjoying a spectacularly redeveloped Ashton Gate. Steve Cotteril has taken Bristol City to the brink of a Championship return after two seasons in League One . City have already won silverware this season in the shape of a Johnstone's Paint Trophy win last month . \u2018There are a lot of big clubs in League One, Two and the Conference with good support. You only have to look at Bristol Rovers and the crowds they get in the Conference,\u2019 Cotterill added after his side\u2019s 1-1 draw at second-placed Preston. The inference was obvious. \u2018We\u2019re on the verge of the Championship and that\u2019s only down to Steve and his investment and what he\u2019s doing at the ground.\u2019 Lansdown, who made his fortune from financial services, is a rare breed in English football, unwavering in ploughing his own fortune into the club through love and nothing else. It hasn\u2019t always been rosy. That strategy was downright naive when they chased the Premier League dream and racked up astonishing debts in doing so. Dean Windass\u2019s memorable winner for Hull City in the 2008 Championship play-off final might have cost Bristol City far more than just missing out on top-flight riches. If Lansdown hadn\u2019t changed his approach they could have folded. Dean Windass hit the only goal of the game as Hull were promoted at the expense of the Robins . Those mistakes \u2014 over-paying for decent but not exceptional players \u2014 meant the owner had to write off an eye-watering \u00a335million worth of debt last year. The age of Financial Fair Play dictates they must live within their means. Lansdown is far more pragmatic with money nowadays, even though Cotterill was allowed to spend \u00a31.65m on four players last summer. They later sold striker Sam Baldock to Brighton for \u00a32m and the squad is among the smallest in all four divisions. Quality, not quantity. \u2018I ain\u2019t quite sure we bought the division,\u2019 Cotterill added. \u2018We pay all these over a period of time, over a couple of years. \u2018We will still potentially need to up our budget from where we are [next season]. I wouldn\u2019t mind betting that Preston have got a bigger budget than us. I\u2019m not saying that to put any pressure on anybody, all I\u2019m saying is that their squad\u2019s bigger than ours and I know their players. Probably Sheffield United as well.\u2019 Aaron Wilbraham celebrates his goal at Preston which kept City's eight-point lead at the top of League One . Bristol City will become the first Football League club to clinch promotion this year should they beat Bradford at Valley Parade on Tuesday, in turn ending a two-year absence from the Championship. They have been staying in a Preston hotel ahead of the trip across the Pennines, training at Burnley today and utilising Cotterill\u2019s contacts. \u2018I was at Burnley for nearly four years,\u2019 he added. \u2018I should be allowed to train on the pitch that I built! We sold Robbie Blake [to Birmingham City for more than \u00a31m in 2004] and built a new pitch. I will take credit for that.\u2019 What he won\u2019t take credit for is City\u2019s rise back where they belong. That\u2019s reserved for one fanatic with very deep pockets.

{"id": "6114adccf141e2f8acdf221b6ca7b42d4df24b1d-0", "article": "(CNN)From banking to hospitality and real estate to e-commerce, Ashish Thakkar built his vast business empire from scratch. The Ugandan tycoon started small with a little computer shop that kept him busy after leaving school at 15. These days, his Mara Group spans over 20 countries and he's been called \"Africa's youngest billionaire.\" In late 2013 Thakkar joined forces with the former boss of Barclays bank -- Bob Diamond -- to start an investment fund focused on Africa called Atlas Mara. The powerful duo raised $325 million through a share flotation - well above the $250 million target. But his vision spans beyond Africa, and Earth -- Thakkar was the first African to sign up for the opportunity to travel to space with Richard Branson's company, Virgin Galactic. CNN's Marketplace Africa spoke to Thakkar about African innovation, entrepreneurship and collaboration. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN:  You are active in several African countries. How is the current business landscape on the continent? Ashish Thakkar: Right now in the last 18 years I have been active on the continent, I have never seen so much global excitement around Africa that I've seen today. The climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved. Unfortunately, it's one of those cases where perception is so different from reality. The reality on the ground is so much better than the perception. You've got to remember, as Africa, we are 54 countries. Some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues, but that cannot be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit. CNN: Why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the African continent? AT: We have a very young demographic -- 85% of our populations are under the age of 35. We have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture. Yet, entrepreneurship is not in the education system. Where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance? And it's something, frankly, that I am extremely passionate about, because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants, etc. It's going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises. So, it's great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system, and innovation is totally embedded into that. CNN: What is it about Africa that encourages innovation? AT: The biggest advantage we have at the moment, and you've seen this with mobile phone penetration, is that we don't have legacy systems. We didn't have landlines and we didn't need them. We didn't have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere. We leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony. Today, we have over 750 million phones on the continent -- more than North America and Western Europe put together. We can actually leapfrog in so many different ways. Mobile money is another brilliant example. Mobile money was created in Kenya. The whole concept of having money on your phone, which is the best thing because it's secure, it's practical, made more sense. So, these kind of innovations, you're going to see a lot more of on the continent. I spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when I travel across the continent, and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that they're coming up with is just so inspiring. CNN: What advice would you give to a young entrepreneur who's just starting out? AT: Entrepreneurship is a journey, it's not a destination. There are going to be so many challenges, you are going to get knocked down so many times, but you've got to get up, dust yourself off and get back to it. The persistence, the passion, and staying on course is very crucial. You'll be tempted to cut corners, you'll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker, but it never lasts. People say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow - we're not. We're the leaders of today, but it's our responsibility to take the seat at the table. CNN: What needs to be done most urgently to grow African economies? AT: Pan-African collaboration is extremely important. I think things like regional integration, inter-African trade does need to increase and is increasing. I mean, the progress in the East African community has been amazing. The manner in which they've harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic. So, we need to see more of that take place on the continent. The fact that we're 54 countries, yet we're a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage. I think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial. CNN: Are you confident about the future of the continent? AT: I am so bullish and so proud of how the continent has evolved in terms of leadership, the mindset of our leaders. It is so inspiring to see that. It's unfortunate that, you know, globally the highlight remains things like Ebola...The little issues that we do have are just magnified, yet on the broad scale we are doing so amazing. CNN: Is this Africa's century? AT: Mara's logo is the African Lion and our little joke, which a lot of people don't appreciate, hence I love it even more, is that the Indian Tiger and the Chinese Dragon have had their days and it's now the African Lion's turn. And it genuinely is -- this is our turn. More from Marketplace Africa . Read this: Africa's green lean speed machines . Read this: Family ties mixed with fresh fruit on island paradise .

Aged 41, Mark O'Meara's chances of a major championship appeared to have gone despite a fine career and many victories on the PGA Tour. But O'Meara shot two birdies in three holes from the 15th on Sunday and a good approach into the 18th left him with a 20-footer to beat David Duval and Fred Couples.

Billy Joe Patton came within a stroke of perhaps the biggest Masters shock of all but narrowly missed out on a play-off with Sam Snead and Ben Hogan. But for a short while it had appeared that an amateur golfer could topple two of the greatest ever to play the game, thanks to his hole-in-one on the par-three sixth on Sunday. Sadly, Patton's hopes were ultimately shot down by a double bogey on the 13th attempting to fly Rae's Creek and reach the green in two. Otherwise his ace would have featured near the very top of this list. Billy Joe Patton hits on the 13th hole... the scene of the double-bogey which ultimately cost him victory . CLICK HERE for the second part of our countdown, featuring videos of shots from the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods... 18 Seve Ballesteros, 1983 . Seve's second Masters victory featured what he called 'the best golf of my life' over the first four holes, and one 205-yard 2-iron on the fourth was utterly spectacular. But nothing quite sums up the genius of the late, great Spaniard than the way he clinched his four-shot victory over Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw. An up and down for a bogey would have comfortably sewn up his victory, but showman Seve was having none of it and chipped in for a par four. 17 Byron Nelson, 1937 . Byron Nelson found himself a somewhat daunting six shots behind Ralph Guldahl in the final round of the 1937 tournament. But his comeback was complete on the par-five 13th after he found the cup with a chip for eagle from off the green, while his rival could only manage bogey. Lord Byron came from four strokes down to two ahead in just 25 minutes, and went on to win the first of his five majors by that same margin.

Vijay skimmed his ball across a lake and watched as it rolled onto the green and into the cup for an ace. You'll need to see it to believe it. 15 Nick Faldo, 1989 . With dark descending, in dank drizzle and with wind whipping the course, Nick Faldo became only the second Briton ever to win the Masters after a play-off with Scott Hoch. His nerveless approach over the water on the 11th hole was good, but the putt was even better. Faldo recalled how his caddie, Andy Prodger, told him it was too dark to see the line of the shot, but he stroked it pure and right into the heart of the cup. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE SHOT . Nick Faldo celebrates his brilliant putt to win the Masters in a play-off in 1989 . 14 Charl Schwartzel, 2011 . Charl Schwartzel's victory three years ago is most famous for his rip-roaring finish - four birdies in the final four holes sealed his first major title - but his start was no less incredible. After missing the first green, the South African somehow chipped in from 100 feet for a remarkable birdie. And then, on the third, he slam-dunked his approach from the fairway for an eagle two. Two incredible shots, but the gods truly were smiling on Schwartzel that day. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . Charl Schwartzel (right) is presented with his green jacket by Phil Mickelson in 2011 . 13 Phil Mickelson, 2004 . Phil Mickelson had long carried the burden of being known as 'the best player never to have won a major' - just ask Lee Westwood how wearisome that feels. Lefty had a string of near-misses behind him - six second and third places - when he went toe-to-toe with Ernie Els over the back nine at Augusta that Sunday. And it all came down to the final green as Phil the Thrill sank an 18-footer for birdie under huge pressure to cast off that unwanted reputation once and for all. 12 Fuzzy Zoeller, 1979 . Imagine playing in your very first Masters... and standing over a putt to win, in a sudden-death play-off. It was the first time the Masters had been decided in such a way, was played in the gathering gloom and also included Ed Sneed and the great Tom Watson. In near darkness, Zoeller held his nerve to sink his birdie putt on the 11th hole and make history. 11 Louis Oosthuizen, 2012 . Some might argue that this is the best shot in Masters history - but some would also say it wasn't even the best shot of the day (see the countdown from 10-1). Whatever, it's hard to think of a more perfectly envisioned, controlled and executed long iron in the history of the game. Oosthuizen catapulted himself into the lead (and an eventual play-off) with this 253-yard approach into the par-five second hole that pitched on a sixpence at the front of the green. From then on, it was never going anywhere other than the centre of the cup.

Charles Collins, 28, sprang into action at the metro station in central Philadelphia when elderly Alfred McNamee lost his footing and fell onto the rails. Surveillance footage of the dramatic incident shows Collins, who was walking ahead of McNamee, turn round when he hears him fall. He walks to the edge of the platform of the Septa (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority) subway's 15th Street station, jumps down and helps McNamee to escape. Savior: Charles Collins is pictured above with Alfred McNamee, whom he rescued after he slipped from a subway platform in Philadelphia . Slip: Alfred McNamee is pictured left falling off the platform at the 15th St station on the Septa metro system in Philadelphia. His rescuer, Charles Collins, is seen in the center of the footage with his back turned and a newspaper in his jeans pocket . To the rescue: After he realized that McNamee had fallen, Collins jumped onto the tracks after him . Collins stepped forward to speak about his actions as footage of the rescue was broadcast on TV screens and online across the nation. But despite the widespread praise for his actions, he put it all down to 'instinct' and denied that he is a hero. McNamee was badly hurt by the fall. He broke his back and several ribs, shattered a kneecap and damaged his spleen - but managed to get away with his life. According to local TV station\u00a0WPVI, Collins went to visit McNamee in hospital the day after the rescue. Heave: Other commuters can be seen to the left pulling McNamee to safety . Hero's return: Collins was pulled from the dangerous tracks - which have an electrified third rail - just after McNamee . The incident took place around 6:30pm on Wednesday - at which time schedules for the Market-Frankford line say a train arrives around every eight minutes. Speaking to WPVI, Collins said: 'I just saw him and jumped down... just instincts'. He also insisted that he's 'not a hero'. Collins hurt his leg during the rescue, but it was only a minor wound. Septa officials commended Collins's bravery, but said that others shouldn't copy him.

Some would quibble with the second part of that statement, but Mourinho says that too will change. If the first 699 games under Russian rule has established Chelsea at the top of English and European football, Mourinho believes the next 700 will see them supply more players for the English national team as they implement Abramovich\u2019s demand to follow Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Sunday's trip to Loftus Road marks Chelsea\u2019s 700th game under the ownership of Roman Abramovich . Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005 . The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012 . Mourinho also believes Chelsea\u2019s adherence to FFP \u2014 \u2018compared with other clubs and owners who didn\u2019t want to play under the rules\u2019, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City \u2014 positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for \u00a3140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of \u00a3842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich\u2019s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has\u00a0has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge . The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004 . \u2018He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,\u2019 said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. \u2018Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that\u2019s very, very good. I think it\u2019s important and I think it\u2019s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. \u2018The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn\u2019t accept the rules and didn\u2019t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003 . \u2018Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. \u2018Now we are going through a period where it\u2019s just about Gary Cahill. But we have some young boys coming into the first-team. Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is already here. Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].\u2019 Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad . Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come . Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England\u2019s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season\u2019s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March . Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club . He added: \u2018Don\u2019t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don\u2019t want to speak again about that game. \u2018Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. \u2018Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don\u2019t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don\u2019t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It\u2019s just us.\u2019 Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season .

Villa earned a comeback win to book their place in the FA Cup final against Arsenal and end Steven Gerrard\u2019s dream of lifting the famous old trophy on his birthday before bidding farewell to the club. Sherwood was dealt a blow by Gabby Agbonlahor\u2019s failure to overcome a hamstring injury, but adapted his plans to brilliant effect as Liverpool struggled to cope with Villa\u2019s fluid attack. Christian Benteke is congratulated by Aston Villa team-mate Fabian Delph after scoring at Wembley . The Villa manager said: \u2018We changed the way we played. We normally go very direct, and use our pace down the sides, I think Liverpool would have expected us to do that. \u2018But we played it short through the thirds and caused some problems in the little pockets of areas. They were a little bit bamboozled to be honest. \u2018We needed to create a threat. I\u2019m not sure Liverpool tried to second-guess what we were going to do but I don\u2019t think they would have expected that.\u2019 \u2018We looked Liverpool and thought it might cause them a few problems if we played two No.10s with Jack Grealish and Charles N\u2019Zogbia and it turned out that way. They got them on the back foot. \u2018We needed to get players in support of Christian Benteke. I thought our game plan worked perfectly. We weren\u2019t worried about what Liverpool were going to do. We just knew if we played like we can we were going to cause them a lot of problems.\u2019 Brendan Rodgers conceded his side had been second best, but praised captain Gerrard, who had a late header cleared off the line. Aston Villa players chase Delph after the England midfielder made it 2-1 with 36 minutes left on the clock . \u2018He was doing everything, everything he possibly could to help the team,\u2019 said the Liverpool boss. \u2018I thought he was excellent. But collectively we didn't perform well enough to get a victory.\u2019 Sherwood kept faith with Grealish, the 19-year-old academy graduate, after handing him his first Premier League start against Queens Park Rangers a fortnight ago. He did not disappoint, playing a part in Benteke\u2019s equaliser, then setting up Delph\u2019s winner. \u2018The bigger the stage the better he plays, the more he relishes it,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018That\u2019s the sign of a good talent. Jack\u2019s someone I looked at before I was at the club and when I\u2019ve seen him in training, if you give him an instruction he sticks to the plan. He\u2019s got a big future at the football club.\u2019 Delph and team-mate Ashley Westwood celebrate their FA Cup win over Liverpool at Wembley . Grealish, who wears children\u2019s shinpads and socks rolled down, won two free-kicks for his team through dribbling with the ball. \u2018He\u2019s very durable,\u2019 added Sherwood. \u2018You should see the size of his legs, he\u2019s still a kid, he\u2019s still learning. He takes more kicks in training than he does on the pitch so he\u2019 s getting a lot of practice fending off those kicks \u2013 he probably needs bigger pads!\u2019 Benteke scored his ninth goal in seven games to level Philippe Countinho\u2019s opening goal, before Delph found the net for the second time under Sherwood, following his quarter-final goal against West Bromwich Albion. He failed to score under Paul Lambert this season. \u2018When I came to the club Fabian Delph had just signed a new contract, he had an opportunity to go to some of the teams in the top four. He showed a lot of loyalty to Aston Villa. I need characters like that, who put themselves on the line, show that spirit. Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho is mobbed by his team-mates after opening the scoring . \u2018I\u2019ve never seen him have a bad game here at Wembley for England and he\u2019s not had a bad one today, so hopefully he plays well in the final. \u2018He can add goals to his game, he has so much energy he can get into the final third and score. He\u2019s nicked a couple of goals for me already. I just want to encourage him to do that and then he\u2019ll be too expensive for anyone to buy!\u2019 On Benteke, Sherwood added: \u2018He\u2019s done that consistently for me. When I first come in I couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d only scored 12 goals with that strike force. I saw something wrong and viewed the tapes and saw they weren\u2019t getting the service.\u2019 Coutinho spreads his arms out wide after scoring during his side's surprise FA Cup defeat . Sherwood praised Villa\u2019s 32,000 fans and turned his attention to Arsenal. \u2018They were fantastic. It\u2019s easy to support your team when they\u2019re winning but even at 1-0 down I thought they were great and dragged the boys back. \u2018I watched the other semi-final yesterday and I saw how calm Arsene Wenger was after the game. But he probably realises there\u2019s nothing won. \u2018I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be Arsene Wenger after that final whistle, I was just delighted and I had to spill out them emotions. \u2018We\u2019ll be the underdogs, the pressure is on Arsenal, they\u2019re the holders and they\u2019ll want to win it again.

Lukaku was absent injured as Phil Jagielka\u2019s goal settled this match to give Everton a third straight victory. But the win came in the wake of Lukaku\u2019s new agent Mino Raiola saying Lukaku would never have signed for Everton had he been his representative earlier. \u2018Later on, he\u2019ll play for one of world\u2019s best teams: PSG, Manchester City, Manchester United or Bayern Munich,\u2019 Raiola said, sparking uncertainty over the future of the 21-year-old Belgian, who became Everton\u2019s record signing when moving from Chelsea for \u00a328million last summer. Romelu Lukaku (left) has had some big claims made about him by his new agent Mino Raiola (right) Roberto Martinez has dismissed claims suggesting his star striker could leave Goodison Park . Southampton have scored just five goals in nine games since the start of February (0.55 per game). This is less than a third the rate before that (1.68 per game). \u2018In the modern game you don\u2019t get the values of 25 years ago,\u2019 said Martinez, implying a decline in standards of behaviour by agents. \u2018But when you have a player on a long-term contract there is nothing to discuss. That is straightforward and clear.\u2019 Lukaku signed a five-year contract at Goodison so will have four years remaining after this summer. \u2018My focus is that Rom keeps on developing,\u2019 Martinez said. \u2018Without a doubt we have been the best club for him because he has had his two best seasons that he has had as a professional and we love Romelu. Agent Raiola said he would have never sanctioned Lukaku\u2019s \u00a328million move to Goodison Park . Raiola hinted that Everton are just a stepping stone for Lukaku on his route to the very top . \u2018It has been a joy to see him developing, there is going to be a lot of talk when you score goals as a striker, you are going to get the attraction of other teams \u2026 If an agent is going to make those comments, then it is normal that you are going to ask about it. An agent can say whatever they want and it is down to everyone else to see what is behind it.\u2019 Martinez\u2019s counterpart, Ronald Koeman, admitted Saints\u2019s chances of Champions League football next season were all but extinguished by this defeat. \u2018It\u2019s not realistic [now] to finish in the top four,\u2019 he said.\u2019", "candidate": "Everton beat Southampton 1-0 at Goodison Park on Saturday.

The disgraced ESPN sports reporter has been suspended for a week since footage emerged showing her unleash a vicious verbal attack on a single mother-of-three at a towing firm. Her car had been towed from the parking lot of a Chinese restaurant in Virginia, where she left it overnight on Easter Weekend. When she picked it up, infuriated, she resorted to insulting the employee's looks, intelligence, and social status. But despite viewers' calls for harsher punishment, the network has reinstated the 28-year-old to her role with a spot on SportsCenter this weekend. Confirming the news to Sports Illustrated, senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said: 'She knows she made a mistake. She\u2019s owned up to it. I think she is just really anxious to get back to work.' Scroll down for video . She's back! Britt McHenry (left) has been reinstated as an ESPN sports reporter after being filmed attacking tow clerk Gina Michelle (right) for her looks and social status in a video the sparked mass outrage . Vicious: ESPN sports reporter Britt McHenry was suspended for one week after the April 6 video surfaced . Markman insisted 'she has a lot of potential as a reporter', adding, 'she is young, she\u2019s learning some things, but I really do believe in her.' He continued: 'We had a conversation where we both talked about that it would take time and it will be hard. She knows that, and especially at the beginning. 'She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers. We expect that from her, and I expect that from her. 'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn\u2019t make me think she will rebound from this. But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy.' Online petitions for McHenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office, where clerk Gina Michelle was stood behind the counter. 'I\u2019m in the news, sweetheart, I will f*****g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying  in the video. Michelle can be heard warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding:\u00a0'That\u2019s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this. Caught red-faced: Incredibly, McHenry was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant, however continued to insult the woman's looks, education and job on-camera . Unhappy customer: Britt McHenry leaving the towing company and flipping a finger to the cameras . Warning: Since Britt McHenry's outburst, this sign has been placed on the door of the Chinese restaurant . Scene of the tirade: This is the towing yard in Arlington, VA, where McHenry's abusive rant happened . Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Michelle patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money\u2026 with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling Michelle she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f*****g trailer, honey.' Finally, before walking away, McHenry says: 'Lose some weight, baby girl.' Although she issued an apology on Twitter, the sportscaster did not approach Michelle directly. The apology: McHenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online Thursday . Hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on Twitter as ESPN refuses to comment further . At first, McHenry tweeted insisting she had been in the right. But that post was deleted within hours. Employees at the beer hall-cum-Chinese-restaurant Hunan Number One told Daily Mail Online the sports reporter left her car in the parking lot overnight despite clear signs on the door that cars will be towed, warning bar-goers that the restaurant would not be responsible 'if your car is towed from the parking lot'. The venue, which features 'happy hour' from 11am until 9pm, was described by enthusiastic patrons as a prime 'pre-game' spot and online reviewers as a beloved dive bar. Hunan Number One, offers sushi, hot-wings and other bar food, along with 32oz draft beers for around $8, five-buck highballs and half-price bottles of wine, served up in front of big screen TVs playing sports. When the bar shuts at 2am, the private towing company, Advanced Towing, within minutes began removing cars in concurrence with a rule on the private lot. The firm showed\u00a0magnanimity, saying it did not want McHenry to\u00a0suffer. In a statement Advanced Towing said: 'Parking enforcement is contentious by nature. At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry.

The Scottish presenter revealed that attending the classes - up to four times a week - has helped her drop two dress sizes, from a 14 to a 10. Scroll down for video . Lorraine Kelly (pictured left) has managed to drop two dress sizes by attending regular Zumba classes with her instructor, Maxine Jones (pictured right) Zumba is a fitness programme, combining Latin and international music, and incorporates aerobic elements across various styles of dance. The classes vary in price, but average at about \u00a35. In an interview with\u00a0Woman, Kelly gushed about\u00a0her Zumba instructor, Maxine Jones. She said: 'Maxine's changed my life. I have more energy now and that helps me look and feel younger.' In the interview, the 55-year-old also revealed her excitement about her new weight loss. As the presenter of her own eponymous ITV show, which airs early in the morning every weekday, it's understandable that feeling good in front of the camera is important to Kelly.

She explained: 'I've never had a waist before, I didn't have that curviness, but now I have and I look better. 'I'm a size 10 and I love being able to go into the shops and buy a top because I like it and not because I want to hide my bottom.' Kelly also explained that Zumba had helped her develop a new-found confidence, and that at the age of 55, she had more confidence than she had ever felt. She added: 'I was never unfit, but I was never truly fit. I'd done marathons but more out of determination. 'But Zumba is so much fun\u2026I feel more confident now in my fifties than I have ever felt. Confidence comes from within.' And Lorraine also found a friend for life in instructor Maxine.

After a first win in eight, they are back in this consuming promotion race and that six-week wobble is no longer. Steele lapped up the adulation, entertaining 4,000 behind one goal of the DW Stadium at which the Rams wrapped up three crucial points. This felt very important indeed, the outpouring of each ol\u00e9 obvious. Derby's players celebrate after Chris Martin's goal gave them the lead in the second half . Steve McClaren was all smiles as he took his place in the stands before the game . Wigan (4-4-2): Al Habsi; Boyce (McCann 63), Maguire, Pearce, Bong; Bo-kyung, Kvist, Perch McClean; Clarke (Waghorn 75), Fortune (Murphy 65). Subs not used: Carson, Pennant, Barnett, Ojo.

Subs not used: Roos, Lingard, Whitbread, Hanson. Goals: Martin 51, Bent 81. Booked: Hughes, Hendrick. Referee: S. Hooper. Attendance: 14,697. Make no mistake, these have been tough times for Steve McClaren. Top of the tree back on February 24, the Derby manager is now only looking at promotion via the play-offs, labelling an automatic spot a \u2018long shot\u2019. Their ticket for those extra games is by no means booked, but goals from substitute Chris Martin and Darren Bent mean they are back on track. Martin climbed off the bench at half-time to change the game, slamming in the opener six minutes after the restart before Bent capitalised on shambolic defending to prod in a late second. \u2018I didn\u2019t think Chris would make the impact that he did,\u2019 McClaren admitted after Martin\u2019s first appearance in almost two months. \u2018He could only play 45 minutes. \u2018It\u2019s a massive win. Huge character. We showed the quality we\u2019ve been missing. The away following was absolutely incredible. We\u2019ve stuck together.\u2019 Wigan, by contrast, are staring at relegation and a first season in the third tier since 2003. Now eight points adrift, their fans chanted for the head of Malky Mackay. Chairman David Sharpe didn\u2019t know where to look at full-time and they need two wins from trips to Fulham and Millwall - on Friday and next Tuesday respectively - to stand any chance of survival. Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant does well to tip over a header from a Wigan corner . Derby winger Tom Ince has a low effort saved by Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi . Jeff Hendrick rides a challenge from South Korea international Kim Bo-kyung . \u2018It\u2019s still mathematically possible and we need to keep giving it everything we\u2019ve got,\u2019 Mackay said. \u2018It was criminal to miss those chances but that has haunted the club all season. \u2018I thought we were terrific first half - 17 crosses into their box. That should bring a return of two goals.\u2019 It did not, and Mackay\u2019s use of \u2018mathematical\u2019 tends to suggest the writing is on the wall. James McClean and Kim Bo-kyung both went close but Wigan ran out of steam, their fans streaming out after Bent\u2019s 81st-minute clincher. Kim shifted the ball to his left foot and found James McClean, storming towards the six-yard box but the winger\u2019s bullet header was met in stature by Lee Grant\u2019s splendid one-handed stop, tipping over while airborne. Tom Ince had the beating of his man inside the box, but could only fluff right-footed straight at Ali Al Habsi. Maguire almost put through his own net from a Jamie Ward corner but those two moments were all McClaren\u2019s side could muster before the break, finding the quagmire of a playing surface at the DW Stadium quite a deterrent. This had been used for the Warriors\u2019 win against St Helens in their Rugby League encounter on Good Friday, and you could tell; a tame Kim drive bobbled three times to test Grant when otherwise it would not have. But, frankly, that is the least of Wigan\u2019s worries. They face an almighty task to escape relegation, made all the harder when Martin linked up with Russell to score. \u2018The difference with him and without him shows you what a top striker can do,\u2019 Mackay rued. Chris Martin celebrates after giving Derby the lead in the crucial promotion clash . Grant saves at the feet of Leon Clarke as relegation-threatened Wigan press for a second-half equaliser . It\u2019s 20 for the season now and how they have missed the Scotland international\u2019s presence. He came on with purpose, knocked the normally immovable Maguire from pillar to post and gave the Rams a focus. Ince just poked over the bar after super build-up involving Martin and Bent, before the on-loan Aston Villa striker wrapped up the points after 81 minutes. Bent comes alive in the 18-yard box and reacted quickest to Jason Pearce\u2019s terrible mix-up to add a second. Wigan did have their chances. McClean was smothered brilliantly by Grant as the Ireland international looked to equalise; William Kvist then saw a half-volley superbly blocked by Hughes. They displayed guts, but not an awful lot of quality, and a first season below the top two divisions since 2003 looks to be the legacy created by Dave Whelan in controversially appointing Mackay. \u2018We want Malky out,\u2019 was the summation of 10,000 home fans.

{"id": "3041e46bce555b63b6d3e463e5abe69789cf52ce-1", "article": "(CNN)In 1944, 16-year-old Yong Soo Lee of Taegu, Korea, was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older Japanese man. The man took the two of them, and three other teenage girls, by train, then ship, to Taiwan. There, the girls were forced into sexual slavery, serving four to five Japanese soldiers every day for a year. Lee suffered beatings and torture, was infected with a venereal disease, was fed paltry amounts of food, faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body, and was never allowed outside. Only the end of World War II brought her relief. Lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and other Asian nations, who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. These so-called \"comfort women\" suffered unimaginable physical, emotional, and psychological trauma. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses a Joint Meeting of Congress on Wednesday, he has an opportunity to do right by these women, and issue an unequivocal and irrefutable apology -- something that carries the weight of his government. In 2007, in the very same chamber the prime minister will be issuing his address, the House of Representatives sent a profound message to the Japanese government by unanimously passing House Resolution 121, which I authored. The resolution called on the Japanese government to formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner for its Imperial Armed Forces' coercion of young women into sexual slavery; publicly refute any claims that the sexual enslavement and trafficking of the \"comfort women\" never occurred; and educate current and future generations about this horrible crime. We are still waiting for their government to comply. In 2006, during his first term, Prime Minister Abe unleashed an international firestorm of criticism when he stated that there was no evidence of Japanese coercion and complicity in setting up and running the \"comfort women\" system. And during his second term, Abe and his right-wing allies have continued to question history -- even trying to dilute and rewrite it. Last year, I, along with 17 of my House colleagues, wrote to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, calling the timing and contents of the Japanese government report on the 1993 Kono statement: regrettable, unfortunate, unacceptable, and destabilizing. Last year, meanwhile, the Abe administration tried (and failed) to get the United Nations to partially retract their authoritative 1996 report, which called on Japan to apologize to the victims and pay reparations to survivors who had been forced into sex slavery. Most notably, earlier this year, the Japanese government tried unsuccessfully to change passages in U.S. history textbooks about the \"comfort women.\" Some say that Japan has already apologized enough and it's time to move on. To those people I say, in light of these continued attempts to rewrite history, for every step forward the Japanese government takes toward peace and reconciliation, it takes two steps back. As someone who was put into an internment camp as an infant, I know firsthand that governments must not be ignorant of their pasts. In 1942, during World War II, my government put aside the constitutional rights of Japanese Americans and systematically incarcerated 120,000 of us. We were U.S. citizens, but merely because of our ancestry, the government treated us like the enemy. Decades later, we, the Japanese American community, fought for an apology from our government. In 1988, Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed into law, the Civil Liberties Act, which was a formal apology to United States citizens of Japanese ancestry who were unjustly put into internment camps during World War II. Our government made a mistake, but they apologized for it, and healed many wounds as a result. Japan must now do the same. It must show the maturity of a democratic country, apologize for its mistake, and thereby gain the trust of her sister Asian nations. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Prime Minister Abe to face Japan's history. Germany knows something about this. After World War II, Germany engaged in a painful national \"coming to terms with the past\" that ripped open old wounds so that they could properly heal. Time is of the essence. Today, there are fewer than 100 surviving \"comfort women\" across the Asia-Pacific. Each year, this number declines. Ms. Lee is one of 53 remaining Korean survivors. The survivors are dying by the day. They deserve the justice and apology that has been due to them for the past 70 years. The opportunity to speak to a joint meeting of Congress is an honor that is reserved for heads of state of our closest allies. I will be in the House chamber when Prime Minister Abe delivers his address. Ms. Lee will attend as my guest. Both of us hope the Prime Minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally, and firmly, apologize, and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly. Ms. Lee and her sisters deserve no less.", "candidate": "U.S. Rep.

As of Tuesday night, the most pertinent one available to him is 115. That is the number of goals Guardiola's Bayern team have scored so far this season, a number plenty enough to take them in to the last four of the Champions League, the semi-final of the German Cup and to the cusp of successive Bundesliga titles. It's a funny game, football isn't it? People can grow restless, unhappy even, pretty quickly.

Referee: Martin Atkinson (England) 8 . Attendance: 70,000 . Well, despite the horrors of the 3-1 first leg defeat in Portugal last week, that remains very much on and the statistics show that Guardiola and his players have indulged in a fair amount of self-expression along the way. Guardiola won't remember all the season's goals. He won't remember all of the seven Bayern scored against Roma and against Shakhtar, the eight they plundered at home to Hamburg or the six they put past SC Paderborn. The Spaniard will remember the half dozen his team scored here on Tuesday night, though. He will remember them - especially the five that came in a brutal, spellbinding opening half - because they will be set against the background of last week's defeat and the disgruntlement that followed. Questions were asked about his own future, Bayern's club doctor walked out, slamming the door behind him. By half-time, though, those matters seemed rather distant already and that is what brilliant football does. It makes people forget the small details. That, in a way, is the whole point of sport. Certain Bayern's rather entitled supporters will have seen little better than this over the years. Not just because of the quality of the football but because of the context and because of the sheer hunger and monotonous forward drive of this team. 'I knew my players could do this,' said Guardiola afterwards. 'But this was not perfect. We can still improve.' Having started so badly in the first leg last week \u2013 Bayern were two down early\u2013 they needed to reverse things quickly. After 23 minutes they were two goals up and, from that point on, the contest was no longer valid. Lewandowski had already struck the post when Bayern took the lead, left-back Juan Bernat crossing to the near post for Thiago Alcantara to thump in a header. The goal served to break the tension a little and as Porto failed to settle, Bayern began a hypnotic and relentless journey through the gears. A shot from Thomas Muller was saved by Fabiano soon after but that proved a rare moment of competence for the Porto goalkeeper. He had a poor night and was beaten for the second time midway through the half when Jerome Boateng glanced a header in by the post after a corner. At this point, Bayern were already mathematically through. Porto needed to score to maintain an interest but they were too skittish, too panicked and too intent in arguing with referee Martin Atkinson to ever get a foothold in a game that quickly galloped away from them. Bayern Munich celebrate in front of their delighted fans after overturning a first leg deficit to reach the Champions League semi-finals . Muller celebrates with supporters at the full-time whistle while Porto defender Maicon looks dejected as Porto surrendered a first leg lead .

Porto defender Diego Reyes slides in to a challenge to dispossess Bayern Munich frontman Mario Gotze during the first half . Colombia international Jackson Martinez, who scored Porto's third goal in the first leg, controls and shields the ball from Rafinha . The third goal arrived soon after \u2013 Lewandowski finishing first time after Philipp Lahm had set him up beautifully \u2013 and it was at this point a massacre seemed in the offing. A drive from Muller from distance then struck defender Casemiro and span through Fabiano's flapping legs in the 36th minute and, after a rare Porto attack culminated in a dive by, and a booking for, Jackson Martinez, Lewandowski struck again, teasing two defenders before arrowing a perfect shot in to the corner with his right foot. Half-time found the Portuguese on their knees and they crawled to the dressing room. Beyond that, Bayern lost some momentum and Porto even scored a goal, Martinez heading in. On the touchline, however, Guardiola's greatest inconvenience was a split to the seam of his suit trousers. As time wore on, he continued to instruct his players feverishly. At times he must be exhausting to play for. In the stands here, meanwhile, Manchester City's football director Txiki Begiristain looked on covetously as Xabi Alonso curled in a free-kick at the death after the dismissal of Ivan Marcano.

In the first minute of added time he bullied Gareth McAuley to gain possession by the halfway line and advanced on goal. Joleon Lescott was unable to halt him and in a flash the ball was in the net. Pearson turned to his bench and held both arms aloft. He had switched to three at the back at the interval and made all his substitutions with half an hour to go, and been vindicated. Trailing 2-1, Leicester had equalised in the 80th minute when Marc Albrighton delivered a cross that reached David Nugent at the far post. He hooked the ball back, Marcin Wasilewski won the header and Robert Huth nodded beyond Craig Dawson on the line.

It had all begun so brightly for the hosts on a day to honour their late, great striker Jeff Astle, scorer of the winning goal in the 1968 FA Cup. West Brom looked resplendent in their replica kits from that year, numbered one to 11. Darren Fletcher paid a fitting tribute with a very good glancing header to Chris Brunt\u2019s corner. Goal-line technology was required to confirm the goal after Esteban Cambiasso cleared. It was Fletcher\u2019s first goal since scoring for Manchester United in November 2012. Leicester equalised in the 20th minute. Cambiasso took a long free-kick that Leonardo Ulloa flicked forward for Nugent to stroke in a composed finish. West Brom went ahead again six minutes later when Craig Gardner\u2019s volley deflected off Wes Morgan into the net. But Leicester struck back impressively and, from nowhere, have genuine hope of survival. \u2018You never want to come off the field with regrets,\u2019 said Pearson. \u2018If we can maximise that home advantage we have a chance. I don\u2019t think at any point this season [the] players doubted themselves.\u2019 West Brom are not yet safe and face a frightening run-in. \u2018The first goal is lower-league stuff,\u2019 said Pulis. \u2018The third goal, Gareth\u2019s trying to play like a right winger.

Kenny Jackett\u2019s team moved into sixth place in the Championship with a fourth successive victory after David Edwards, the substitute, headed home two minutes from the end of an unpredictable and thrilling game. Pre-match results had offered Wolves a prospective route into the play-off zone, with Brentford and Ipswich Town dropping points unexpectedly, and Kenny Jackett reflected the burgeoning confidence within Molineux by naming an unchanged starting line-up from the side that prevailed 2-1 at Nottingham Forest on Friday for a third successive victory.

With a day less to recover, Leeds had also been on a decent run before Saturday\u2019s 3-0 home defeat by Blackburn Rovers topped another distressing chapter in their tumultuous recent history. Neil Redfearn, the head coach, had said he would consider his future after this game at Wolves after his assistant Steve Thompson had been suspended without explanation. Although Massimon Cellini, Leeds\u2019 banned owner, has subsequently claimed Thomson had used abusive language towards sporting director Nicola Salerno, it was only another spanner in the works for this once-proud club who need stability more than anything. Still, it was Leeds who struck the first blow, courtesy of a poor defensive clearance from Kevin McDonald who, penned back towards his own corner flag by debutant Kalvin Phillips, attempted a loose clearance that cannoned off Richard Stearman, his own team-mate, for Charlie Taylor to sidefoot under Carl Ikeme. Even before the January arrival of Benik Afobe, now level with Harry Kane as the leading goalscorer in all four divisions, Wolves have happily relied on either and both of the Mali combination of Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko. It was the latter who earned Jackett\u2019s team the lead by half-time. Dicko equalised from the tightest of angles when a cross-shot from Afobe, all loping legs and dizzying stepovers, eluded Marco Silvestri. It still needed a cute finish as the former Wigan striker lifted his shot over Scott Wootton from the byline for his 12th goal of an increasingly impressive season. Alex Mowatt looks delighted after putting Leeds back on level terms by scoring his side's third goal . Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme  dives in vain as Mowatt makes it 3-3 before Edwards' late winner . Leeds attempted to disrupt Wolves\u2019 rhythm with some fiercely competitive tackling, Phillips receiving one caution for fouling McDonald then fortunate not to be dismissed for a foul that ripped holes in the former Sheffield United midfielder\u2019s sock. The home side started to put together the pieces of their flowing passing game as half-time approached however and, in stoppage time, Leeds conceded at what appeared to be the worst time. Their defence appeared to disappear as Sako played in Dicko who took his time before firing in off the near post. Wolves turned the screw at the start of the second half as Afobe joined in the goalscoring fun three minutes after the restart. The former Arsenal striker, who scored 19 times on loan for MK Dons in the first half of the season, attempted an audacious overhead kick from Jack Price\u2019s cross into the area. Sako kept play alive, dropping the ball back for Batth, whose shot hit Dicko but fell back for Afobe to smash in his tenth goal for Wolves. Leeds looked as if they might capitulate at this stage before Wolves offered them a lifeline back into the game in the 66th minute. Alex Mowatt\u2019s dink into the penalty area looked pretty harmless and a cry of \u2018leave it\u2019 could be heard from the press box, presumably from Ikeme, only for Batth to lunge and divert the ball past his own goalkeeper. Richard Stearman was the next guilty party in the Wolves defence as he gave the ball away cheaply to Mowatt who cut inside and from outside the penalty area curled home a superb equaliser into the top corner. Wolves do possess strength in depth however and in David Edwards they have a midfielder who not only works as hard as anyone in pressing the ball but also chips in with crucial goals. So it was that the substitute rose two minutes from time to head McDonald\u2019s telling cross into the top corner to wrap up the win that took Wolves into sixth place.

Nicole, a 30-year-old woman, doesn't have to imagine this scenario because it's her everyday reality.  The small and unusual living space is all that this employed, single mother can afford in her high-cost community in San Mateo, California. Nicole isn't alone in her struggles. CNN recently published a powerful piece called \"Poor kids of Silicon Valley\" that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the Bay Area.  One aspect featured a house that is home to 16 people, including 11 children.  Another chronicles a husband and wife named Rich and Stacey, both of whom have jobs, who are living in a San Jose homeless shelter with their two kids because they don't have the money to go anywhere else. Although Silicon Valley has unique characteristics, it isn't the only community confronting these challenges.  Our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis.  The agency I lead, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, recently released a report estimating that 7.7 million low-income households live in substandard housing, spend more than half their incomes on rent or both. These are families who are dedicating $1 out of every $2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head.  And the more they spend on housing, the less they have to invest in their children's education, build up savings and shop at local businesses.  These are outcomes that hurt our nation's economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action. HUD is working with local partners across the country to do just that. First, we're focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists. Since the mid-1970s, we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700,000 affordable units.  But by 2020, we're in danger of losing more than 125,000 because these mortgages are maturing, ending agreements to control rents in these units.  So we've launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come. We're also doing the same with public housing. Right now, the nation is losing 10,000 units of public housing every year, mainly because of disrepair, HUD created the Rental Assistance Demonstration  initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good. It's cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as Lexington, North Carolina, where the local housing authority is making 58 years' worth of repairs in just 22 months, including new lighting, modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs. RAD has allowed local communities to raise more than $733 million in new capital to date. That's why we're asking Congress to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program. No American should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home. In addition to preservation, HUD is also working to create new affordable housing.  A Harvard study revealed that in 2012, there were 11.5 million extremely low-income households and only 3.3 million affordable units available.  It's clear that we can't preserve our way out of this problem.  We've got to grow the supply to meet demand, so HUD is taking a multifaceted approach. For example, our HOME Investment Partnerships Program is leveraging $4 in private and other public resources for every $1 in HOME funds and leading to more than 1 million new and rehabilitated units for rent or sale to lower income families. This is more than just a statistic: It is progress for people, from the families living in the Broadway Crossing development in Washington to the seniors living in the Woodcrest Retirement Residence in Pennsylvania.  To keep this momentum going, we've asked Congress to increase HOME funding by 16% to keep building affordable homes, prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation. We are also asking Congress to expand our Housing Choice Voucher Program, which allows recipients of modest means, the elderly, and people with disabilities to find housing in the private market.  This includes restoring 67,000 vouchers that were lost to sequestration. And we're targeting our resources where they can have a big impact. For instance, HUD awarded $94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the San Francisco Bay Area, including Silicon Valley, in January.  And we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment. To empower communities, President Barack Obama has also requested $300 million for new Local Housing Policy Grants to help them increase housing affordability, economic growth and access to jobs. All of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coast-to-coast. Our nation's affordable housing challenges won't be solved overnight, and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper. Let's not squander this chance to make real progress for American families. Incredible things can happen when a wide variety of leaders come together for the common good. By leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state, local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners, I know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all.", "candidate": "U.S. is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis, HUD Secretary Julian Zelizer says.

It's not the first time a child has been accused of eating her parents out of house and home \u2013 but in Jessica Knight\u2019s case, it\u2019s literally true. The four-year-old has an unusual appetite for furniture, soft furnishings and fittings, and doctors say they are unable to treat her. Hardly anything is off the youngster\u2019s menu, with the filling from a rocking horse, padding in an armchair and even carpet underlay taking her fancy. Other non-food items she devours include sand and chips of cement from paving blocks. Jessica suffers from pica, a rare medical disorder that leads to an appetite for non-nutritious substances. It is more commonly recognised among pregnant women, some of whom develop unusual cravings. \u2018I was really shocked when I realised just how much she was eating. If you lift up the carpet in her room now you can see there is no underlay left,\u2019 said her mother, Kelly Will. \u2018We are at our wits\u2019 end. We try to keep her busy so she doesn\u2019t do it, but if we try to stop her she will find a way to do it. \u2018I\u2019d have to remove everything from my house, including all chairs and sofas.\u2019 Miss Will, 36, first noticed the problem when Jessica was two and began eating the filling from a children\u2019s armchair. Staff at her pre-school also spotted her licking her hands and placing them in a sandpit before sucking the grains from her fingers, before tell-tale signs of snack-attacks became clear from the damage to items around the house. Jessica, who has a three-year-old sister, Jennifer, is now allowed to keep a small purse filled with some of the spongy underlay to eat. Cravings: Jessica's Pica makes her want to eat substances including sponge, sand and even rocks . Worry: Kelly Knight says doctors are unable to treat Jessica until she is six years old . Her mother, who lives in March, Cambridgeshire, with partner Chris Knight, 40, an engineer, said: \u2018We\u2019d rather she ate the underlay because it is non-toxic. If we try and stop her we fear she will eat something with chemicals in it.\u2019 Pica is an eating disorder that is characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value. These can include stones, sand, paint and dirt. It is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy. It can cause a range of serious complications if the person is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible. These include being poisoned by toxic ingredients and having a part of the body obstructed (which is often seen in people who eat hair). It can also lead to excessive calorie intake, but also nutritional deprivation if the person eats a substance with no nutritional value instead of nutritious foods. The person can also damage their teeth and be infected with parasites. Experts have examined Jessica but said they cannot intervene until she is six, and old enough to make conscious decisions about what she eats rather than acting on impulse. Fortunately, she does like plain sausages, cheese strings, rice pudding, bread, Weetabix and fish fingers. But her unusual snacks can leave her in agony because they cause stomach cramps and constipation. Despite her tender years, Jessica is aware that her diet is highly unusual, and does worry what people would think of her craving different food. She also shuts her little sister out of their shared room when she is satisfying one of her cravings, saying: \u2018I don\u2019t want her to be poorly.\u2019 The family will find out this month if Jessica is on the autistic spectrum, which is often linked to pica. The Challenging Behaviour Foundation, a learning problems charity, said: \u2018It is estimated that four to 26 per cent of people with learning disabilities display pica behaviour. \u2018Whilst some objects pass through the body without harm, pica can potentially be life-threatening. Risks include vomiting, blockages, choking and poisoning.\u2019 Dr Alison Sansome, clinical director at Cambridgeshire Community Services NHS Trust, added: \u2018Pica is a complex condition and treatment is dictated by the specific circumstances in each case.\u2019 Damage: Half of the carpet underlay in Jessica's bedroom has vanished because she has eaten it .

Looking radiant, Daphne Selfe, 86, shows off the collaboration between the footwear\u00a0super-brand\u00a0and the\u00a0ethereal\u00a0high street store with\u00a0uncompromising\u00a0grace. Daphne said of the collection, in which she appears with 22-year-old Flo Dron: 'The & Other Stories\u2019 collection that is featured in this story is truly relaxed and timeless with a modern twist, all in lovely colours.' 86-year-old Daphne Selfe has starred in the campaign for Vans and & Other Stories alongside Flo Dunn, 22 . The images show the new footwear which sees Stories make a twist on the classic vans slip on.\u00a0The shoes are then worn with pieces from the brands SS2015 collection. Daphne's career originally began  in 1949 and she once told the Express: 'Modelling was respectable then so my parents were very happy for me to do it and it was fabulous. 'I still think the Fifties was the best time to be a model because the clothes were so lovely. Of course we were much more innocent. 'There was no television, only the radio and we'd never heard of drugs.' At the time of the interview in 2011 Daphne, from Baldock, Hertfordshire,\u00a0was still commanding \u00a31,000 per day for her work. Daphne looks cool and relaxed as she models the & Other Stories collection alongside the customised shoes . 'That rate is quite rare but it's very nice when it comes and helps the pension,' she said. The model also comes from a time when it was OK to not be super skinny: 'I'm a big-boned person and back in 1950 I was 10st 7lb, although nobody told me to lose weight. 'I didn't do anything to make myself thin but once I had three children I lost weight and now I'm 8st. 'My waist is 28'' so I can sometimes get into a size eight on a shoot but I wear a 10 for comfort. I think it's ridiculous and very sad that some of the models now have become so skeletal.' Flo and Daphne sit side by side as they model almost matching outfits for the two brands . Daphne wears a day time look with lace up vans (left) changing into a red dress for another picture (right) The model has never had any surgery and shies away from botox. She once said: 'I\u2019ve never had anything done to my face. 'Not that poison [botox], not a facelift. I think it\u2019s a waste of money. Anyway, I couldn\u2019t afford it!\u2019 She previously revealed to the MailOnline that she posed nude back in the day for artists such as Barbara Hepworth. The outfits chosen for the campaign look great no matter what age the model is . She revealed that she keeps her grey hair, which is brushed down around her shoulders in the new campaign, long because it is cheaper. She said: 'My hair is long now because it\u2019s cheaper, I don\u2019t have to do anything, but put it in a topknot or a French pleat. 'It avoids that old lady permed look, lengthens the neck and lifts the face. I\u2019ve got so many friends who don\u2019t touch the make-up pot. You should keep looking nice, it makes you feel so much better.\u2019 In modelling shots taken from the earlier part of her career Daphne shows off her effortless grace . Daphne is known for her timeless beauty and has previously admitted to never having had any surgery . Daphne took part in the Dare To Wear campaign in 2014 for the Trafford Center in Manchester . Over the last few years Daphne has landed a number of campaigns with well known brands. In 2013 she was chosen to work for TK Maxx and last year she fronted the Dare To Wear campaign for the Trafford Center in Manchester. Daphne says that she has good genes and maintains a healthy lifestyle: 'My parents gave me good genes and health, and I have always eaten sensibly. 'I was brought up through the war so the phrase \"make do and mend\" has never done me any harm. I always try to make the best of everything, to stay positive and to have a healthy lifestyle.'

United played like Sunderland on a bad day \u2013 they were that horrendous. Recently I wrote about what United need to take them back to a proper challenge for domestic and European glory. Now it's time to name names. Teams will have bad days, of course. It's no surprise to those of us who can see his quality and importance to United, but without Michael Carrick they look far more beatable. I can't see how Everton score that first goal if Carrick is on the pitch. Louis van Gaal needs some big signings in the summer to turn Manchester United into title contenders . Borussia Dortmund's midfield pair of Ilkay Gundogan (left) and Sven Bender (right) fit the bill . Daley Blind is a poverty-stricken pauper's version of Carrick in that position. The Dutchman is a slower version of the Geordie, which is quite an achievement, and so more reinforcements are needed. That's why it would be a good idea for United to raid Borussia Dortmund. Ilkay Gundogan has already been linked with a move to Old Trafford \u2013 it's a no-brainer. This player is physical yet graceful. He can spot a pass and execute it first time. He's dynamic and never hides. Alongside him in that Dortmund midfield is Sven Bender - the German Carrick. These players make relatively few tackles because they anticipate and intercept \u2013 they read the game. Daley Blind struggled to cope in Manchester United's midfield during their 3-0 defeat by Everton . David de Gea, Blind and Ashley Young react after conceding a goal in a big defeat by Everton on Sunday . But when Bender tackles, the opponent knows about it \u2013 he is a beast. Despite his frame (he's 6ft 1in, slightly shorter than Carrick), he is quick to step into a tackle. Opponents think they have a bit of time on the ball but Bender makes up the ground in a flash to rob them. What I'm saying here is that United may need two players to replace Carrick. And those two fit the bill. Both are winners, both have had years in Dortmund playing some magnificent football. And if Louis van Gaal is raiding Dortmund he might as well sign Armenia's finest Henrikh Mkhitaryan. What a playmaker this guy is \u2013 he floats around picking the ball up wherever he can, gets the team into advanced positions and can spot a pass. He can score goals too. Manchester United look far more vulnerable without Michael Carrick in their midfield . Armenian creative threat Henrikh Mkhitaryan has been linked with a move to the Premier League before . Gundogan, like Bender, could be leaving Dortmund this summer along with departing manager Jurgen Klopp . I think he's a more positive version of Juan Mata \u2013 look how often the Spaniard gave the ball away at Goodison on Sunday. There's a lot to admire about Mata's game, but he is one of the guilty ones when you look at the reasons for United being ponderous in their build-up. United also need a centre half and another striker \u2013 it's a work in progress after the post-Fergie collapse. But the Dortmund trio would bring instant reward for Van Gaal. And it's not just plucking names out of nowhere: the timing is right for them to move on just as manager Jurgen Klopp leaves. There is a way any Manchester United team must play \u2013 David Moyes found that out to his cost, and earlier this season Van Gaal listened to the fans' loud and clear disapproval of negative football and passes going backwards too often and changed the way they played. Hoofing it up to Marouane Fellaini has happened \u2013 not as often as the critics make out \u2013 but with certain players out, Van Gaal has felt that tactic is the best way to get results. Van Gaal knows anything less than a top-four finish is failure. Juan Mata was wasteful in possession against Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday . Mkhitaryan (right) challenges Eintracht Frankfurt's Carlos Zambrano during a Bundesliga game . Marouane Fellaini's rebirth has been a big factor in Manchester United's excellent form over the past weeks . So much has been made of Dortmund's poor season, but even during that time they managed to finish top of their Champions League group above Arsenal. And the second half of the campaign has seen a revival that has led them to the top half when before Christmas relegation looked a possibility. These are not bad players just because of half a season. These are players who, if they successfully bring their A game with them from Germany, could improve United's starting XI massively. If United are going to raid a club for good players, there are some rich pickings at Dortmund.\u00a0And I haven't even mentioned Mats Hummels.", "candidate": "Manchester United lost 3-0 to Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday.

It\u2019s another defeat and that\u2019s not good enough. This is the most difficult situation I\u2019ve ever been in but I\u2019m not going to give up on it.\u2019 Although the official attendance was returned as a massively inaccurate 47, 427 \u2013 making it the biggest of the weekend in the top-flight \u2013 estimates had it nearer 40,000 as fans stayed away in protest at Mike Ashley\u2019s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of \u00a318.7million before revealing they have a further \u00a334m in the bank. The billionaire will need to part with a sizeable chunk of that cash this summer if Newcastle are to avoid a season-long struggle against relegation next time around. One banner \u2013 unfurled during a pre-match protest outside of the Gallowgate End \u2013 captured the mood of frustration and mistrust among supporters \u2013 \u2018NUFC \u2013 Balance sheet champions, 2008-2014\u2019. Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Carragher, meanwhile, launched a scathing attack on Ashley. \u2018People will say as supporters you\u2019ve got to come back, you\u2019ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters?\u2019 he said. \u2018Since Mike Ashley\u2019s been here they\u2019ve been relegated once and they could be relegated again. \u2018So he\u2019s balanced the books and he\u2019s made money because he\u2019s a businessman, but I think of these people and wonder, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be excited yourself?\u201d. \u2018I\u2019m getting bored by Newcastle. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there\u2019s nothing happening? There\u2019s no cup run, I just don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t get why he wants to own a football club.\u2019 The defeat leaves Newcastle seven points above the drop zone and Carver has previously confessed that he does not know where their next point is coming from. Tottenham striker Harry Kane at full stretch with of Spurs is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . After Kane was chosen as caretaker of the captain's armband, Jan Vertonghen returned to lead Tottenham at St James' Park . Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Newcastle's Vernon Anita . On this evidence, they may well have to rely on their current tally of 35 being enough. They were hardly helped here by Tim Krul. But perhaps the loss of form of the usually-dependable goalkeeper best represents the problems which have plagued the squad in recent weeks. The Dutch stopper could have done more to keep out Chadli\u2019s first-half opener and was again culpable as Eriksen struck to restore the lead after Jack Colback had levelled early in the second half. Chadli appeared to have exhausted his options as he floated in possession 25 yards from goal only to drop his shoulder before slamming into the bottom corner with Krul sluggish in his pursuit of the strike. Carver reacted to an insipid first half by hooking the ineffective Yoan Gouffran and midfielder Mehdi Abeid and within 20 seconds they were level when Colback steamed onto a loose ball inside the area before slotting home. Chadli was given space outside the box and pulled the trigger just as Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback arrived in defence . Colback is too late as the Belgian laces his shot from range and it nestles in the bottom corner giving Newcastle keeper Tim Krul no chance .

Chadli leaps in the air with delight after his sublime strike for the opening goal of the match . Christian Eriksen (left) tussles with Newcastle's Ryan Taylor at St James' Park on Sunday . But parity was to last just eight minutes and Eriksen\u2019s free-kick \u2013 intended as a cross \u2013 bounced through the weak grasp of Krul and into the back of the net. Krul, in fairness, made a string of fine stops to keep Newcastle within one but he was powerless to prevent Kane rolling beyond him in stoppage-time after he had skipped onto Erik Lamela\u2019s through-ball. In doing so Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to score 30 goals in one season. And the England striker now has Lineker\u2019s total of 35 in his sights. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise for Newcastle . Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at Newcastle's home St James' Park . Fans applaud while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, No Ashley' sign, while Colback's Newcastle team-mates join in the celebrations . \u2018I'm very proud but there are five games left and, hopefully, I'll get a few more goals,\u2019 he said. Manager Mauricio Pochettino added: \u2018We were better than Newcastle and deserved the win. \u2018For Harry, it is a fantastic achievement. We need to push him now because he has a lot of improvement left in him.\u2019 Newcastle, meanwhile, will also need to improve in the final five matches of their sorry season, or risk starting next in the second tier.

{"id": "a5f1e1a538f5a90653811eab4fce66d438361162-2", "article": "It is the age old debate but with a modern twist: which Premier League club is the most popular according to Twitter followers. For the first time ever, fans can see a detailed breakdown of how support for every club varies around the world and in the UK supporters can go as in-depth as seeing the three most popular teams in their local constituency. So, what exactly does the data show? The map was created by looking at the official Twitter accounts for each team, using their followers as an indicator of allegiance. Fans can toggle the map to view their club's support worldwide, see the most popular clubs globally and compare their club with a rival. Using the 'Zoom to' function fans can also look at any country around the world. Liverpool may be struggling in the Premier League and looking at a 2015-16 campaign without Champions League football, but in terms of Twitter followers they dominate the UK. Arsenal have strong support in London and the south east and actually have more followers in the backyards of rivals Chelsea and Tottenham. In Manchester, it is a win for Louis van Gaal's United who dominate the area apart from Gorton where rivals City are more popular. United also have pockets of concentrated support across the UK. Chelsea have strong support in the Western Isles, while clubs such as\u00a0Newcastle, Sunderland, Hull City, Burnley, Stoke City, Leicester City, Aston Villa, Swansea and Southampton dominate their local areas. But while Liverpool completely dominate the UK market, their global appeal is less impressive. Brendan Rodgers' side have a large following across the world with strong support in Thailand, Norway, Iceland, Uruguay and Australia but find themselves playing second fiddle to the Premier League's other giants in other areas. For instance, the rest of Asia apart from Thailand is dominated by Manchester United - who have strong followings in India and Pakistan and edge out Chelsea in\u00a0Malaysia and Indonesia, too. While in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines it is Arsenal who come out on top. The UK (left) is dominated by Liverpool green while South America (right) is very much a strong hold of Chelsea . London and the south east is a sea of yellow reflecting Arsenal's domination, with pockets of support for Chelsea (blue) and Liverpool (green) North America is somewhat surprisingly dominated by Arsenal (yellow) with pockets of support for Chelsea (blue) and Man United (red) Eden Hazard (left) and Ramires (right) in action for Chelsea against a MLS All-Star team during the club's 2012 tour of America . Somewhat surprisingly, United are only the third best supported team in America - despite touring the states frequently over the years and having American owners. Chelsea beat Van Gaal's side to second but it is Arsenal - whose largest shareholder is American Stan Kroenke - who dominate across the pond. Arsenal and Chelsea also split Europe, with Arsene Wenger's side most popular in northern European countries such as France, Germany and Poland and Chelsea taking the south. Arsenal are also well supported in northern Africa (Algeria and Morocco) but further south United turn\u00a0South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe red. Across the globe, Arsenal are the most popular team with 5.6million followers, followed by Chelsea (5.4m) and Manchester United (4.8m). The reasons behind support for a club in any country or area are of course complicated, but certain trends can be explained. For instance, there is often huge support in certain countries for national heroes. Ivory Coast is pro-Chelsea because of Didier Drogba, Uruguay is a Liverpool stronghold due to the now departed Luis Suarez and Bosnia and Herzegovina is light blue thanks to Edin Dzeko's presence at Manchester City. Arsenal went on tour to Asia in 2013 and they will take part in the 2015 Premier League Asia Trophy in Singapore in the summer . In Asia it is Manchester United (red) who just edge the overall support from Chelsea (blue) and Arsenal (yellow) Liverpool dominate Twitter followers in Australia with pockets of support for Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United as well . The Melbourne Cricket Ground was packed to 95,000 capacity when Liverpool took on Melbourne Victory in July 2013 . And this trend doesn't just happen at the so-called bigger Premier League clubs. Swansea are well supported in South Korea and Iceland presumably because of Ki Sung-yueng and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Enner Valencia being at Upton Park has boosted West Ham's following in the striker's native Ecuador and Everton are still popular in Cameroon even though Samuel Eto'o has left the club. Owners may also have a factor - in Malaysia QPR have a stronger-than-average following which could be attributed to the popularity of the club's owner Tony Fernandes in the country. Russia and the former Soviet countries are very much Chelsea hotbeds and again this may be down to the popularity of Roman Abramovich. With clubs always jostling to expand their fan base and Twitter growing popularity, this could be the new battle ground for clubs. Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Diego Costa all contribute to the popularity of Man United, Liverpool and Chelsea across the globe .", "candidate": "Arsenal are the most popular Premier League club according to Twitter followers.

Grandfather Peter Mutty, from Roseberry in Sydney's inner-west, was caught with two cartons of beer, one box of red wine and one box of white wine in his car on August 31 last year while driving home in Riyadh. The possession of alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia. Sydney grandfather Peter Mutty (pictured with his wife, Debbie, and grandchildren) has had a travel ban placed on him after he served time for alcohol possession, which is illegal in Saudi Arabia . While other expats who had committed the same crime in the past were deported, Mutty was ordered to serve jail time according to the Islamic calendar and received 28 of the 75 lashes he was sentenced to have. He said it was not unusual for a reduction in penalty as the point of it was to 'humiliate' a person. The 57-year-old was sent to Thoqba prison in the Al Khobar Eastern Province on October 19 and was released on March 19. He shared the same cell with two murderers, a rapist and thieves. But since he walked free, Mutty has been unable to leave Saudi Arabia or work as he has been banned from travelling out of the country without any explanation as to why this is happening . Mutty's situation has turned so desperate that he and his wife, Debbie, have reached out to family to help them by donating money. He was jailed for six months and 75 lashes, but only received 28. Mutty says he received little assistance from the Australian embassy in Saudi Arabia . The Sydney grandfather does not deny he committed the crime, but he has grown increasingly frustrated with the Australian embassy who he claims have not been taking his case seriously. 'The Australian embassy, who made contact late in the piece with the [Saudi Arabia's] Foreign Ministry, said I would not receive lashes but I did. The whole thing is a complete stuff-up,' Mutty told Daily Mail Australia. 'We don't care what the politics are, [we want them to] take this seriously. An Australian citizen is not being treated fairly.' Mutty said the embassy should have helped him try and find out which department had placed the travel ban on him. 'We don't know who put the travel ban in place. [It could have been] the police, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the office of public prosecution,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'And we can't focus on the right person to lift this travel ban. 'That\u2019s what we're expecting the Australian embassy in Riyadh to do for us. They have to be much more proactive.' Mutty has grown so frustrated with the situation that he has gone public to drum up awareness. 'My own embassy didn't stand up for me and finally we went to Australian media and the embassy has now decided to do something,' he said. After speaking out about his situation to the Australia media, Mutty was now receiving assistance from the embassy . When asked why he had run the risk of getting caught, Mutty answered frankly: 'Because you get complacent. I never thought I would get caught. 'The way life works here for expats is all of us live on compounds and those compounds are secure,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'If you know someone on other compounds, you go to their compound in your car. '[After a barbecue], you take some food and some nibbles and some alcohol [back home], and every time you run the risk. 'It's very unusual expats get stopped by the police here... [but] on this particular day, we got stopped.' Despite his brush with the law in Saudi Arabia, Mutty said he would be willing to return and work in the country. 'I would have no problem coming back to Saudi Arabia to work,' he said. 'I knew the laws of the country. I signed a document that I understood the laws and alcohol ban was listed, so in other words I knew what I was doing and getting myself into.' A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Daily Mail Australia tey had been providing Mr Mutty with consular assistance. 'The Australian Embassy in Riyadh has been providing Mr Mutty with consular assistance in line with the Consular Services Charter from the time he first made contact seeking assistance on 10 September 2014. 'That assistance, which continues, has included visits to him in prison, to ensure his health and welfare were being appropriately safeguarded, and official representations on his case to senior Saudi authorities,' the spokesperson said. 'The Embassy is in contact with Mr Mutty and his legal representative about having the current travel ban lifted so that he can depart Saudi Arabia.'", "candidate": "Sydney grandfather Peter Mutty was caught with homemade alcohol in Saudi Arabia.

The man posed as a member of the congregation of St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester to carry out the crime. As well as taking one bag, he tried to steal the contents of two other elderly women's bags before fleeing. Police have released an e-fit and CCTV footage after a thief stole a pensioner's handbag from a church . The thief sat down in a pew next to the 86-year-old for the Good Friday service earlier this month. After grabbing the bag, he targeted an 82-year-old woman but she was alerted when she heard him rustling in her purse. As he fled the church, the thief tried to snatch the handbag from a third woman, also aged 86. But instinctively the woman pushed the thief away as he tried to pull the bag from her shoulder and he ran off. Police have described the incident on April 3 as 'appalling' and have released an e-fit image of the suspected offender. They are appealing to anyone who recognises him to come forward. The thief is described as being a white man, in his 40s of a medium build and wearing a grey hooded top. The incident happened at\u00a0St James' church in the Gorton area of Manchester on April 3 . Det Con Dave Bennett of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The actions of this underhand and sneaky thief are so shocking that I have no doubt people who live in this area, particularly those who worship at this church, will be very angry. 'He used an important date in the religious calendar and within the sanctity of the church grounds to target elderly women who had simply gone to the church to mark Good Friday.' He added: 'Not only did he pinch one woman's bag, but he also tried to steal two other handbags and was only stopped in his tracks thanks to the vigilance of two of the women. 'It is a sinister, cowardly and disrespectful crime and we need to find the man responsible before he can target anyone else, whether they will elderly people or those attending at the church. 'We have released an accurate likeness of this offender and I would urge people to look very carefully at the image. If you recognise who this man is then please do the right thing and call us. 'Alternatively, I would urge people to be vigilant and if you think you see this man, then please call us straight away.'", "candidate": "Thief posed as a member of congregation at St James' church in Manchester.

The rest of America fell in love because of what happened after the winning putt was holed. The 79th Masters attracted massive ratings in the USA and there is no surprise in that. They tuned in to watch as perfect a demonstration of sporting endeavour as you will ever behold. But they also tuned in to watch a man with a common touch and a depth of sincerity that reached into the heart of every household. Politicians who try so hard to be popular could learn much from 21-year-old Masters champion Jordan Spieth. The green jackets and dignitaries sitting behind him were enraptured as the winner gave an unscripted speech so gracious and natural you would think that public speaking was his calling rather than the Royal and Ancient game. Jordan Spieth wears his new green jacket after winning the Masters at Augusta on Sunday . Spieth hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at Augusta National . Spieth walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on . As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends. And then he remembered his father\u2019s words: \u2018Make sure you say thank you to the people, son.\u2019 So he went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space. With this victory, Spieth must have killed forever the idea that you have to have a cold heart and a ruthless edge to be a winner. You will not find a single pro on the PGA Tour with a bad word to say about him. There is nothing fake about Jordan Spieth. Texans are supposed to be brash and larger than life, right? This one makes jokes about his receding hairline and dislikes being asked why he comes across as humble because, well, that would not be humble. Listen to Phil Mickelson, the Masters specialist who cheerfully admitted he had been outplayed by a man who had competed at Augusta only once before. \u2018He\u2019s just a class guy in every way and it\u2019s difficult not to root for him,\u2019 said the leftie. Spieth watches his tee shot on the seventh hole during the final round . Spieth gives a fistpump after making a birdie putt on the third green on the final day . \u2018This is a momentous week in the history of our game. Along with Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth is going to carry it for the next decade and what an exciting time it promises to be.\u2019 Sir Nick Faldo, on American television, sums up perfectly the feelings of a sport at the end of truly epochal week. Listen to Jack Nicklaus, who posted this tribute: \u2018Congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man. That was an incredible performance. Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about him. He\u2019s polite, he\u2019s humble, he handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he\u2019s obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion.\u2019 The one family member who was not present to enjoy the celebrations was his 14-year-old sister Ellie, who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. Hardly a day goes by when Spieth does not Facetime Ellie and every time they talk she asks him if he has won yet. \u2018I\u2019ll finally be able to tell her yes,\u2019 he said, smiling. When Spieth speaks about Ellie there is no pity or anything maudlin in his voice, only joy, laughter and pride. \u2018I know she was watching on television and I think she\u2019s going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green,\u2019 he said. \u2018She\u2019s going to want a present.\u2019 Golf should not have been Spieth\u2019s game at all. Nobody in the family plays \u2014 they are all big basketball fans. But Spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there. Spieth (front) is presented with his green jacket by last year's Masters champion Bubba Watson . Spieth kisses his girlfriend Annie after a sensational victory at the Masters . Perhaps the only serious criticism he has attracted came when he dropped out of the University of Texas after his first year. It was well-meaning. By the age of 19 he had an amateur record so good he had positively lapped his fellow competitors and done well in the US Open, finishing 21st. But why the hurry? Why not complete his education? Throughout his life Spieth has known exactly what he wants \u2014 from the fact he is still with the girl he met in college to his caddie Michael Greller. He is a maths teacher by trade but Spieth persuaded him to come out on tour after the pair hit it off straightaway. Spieth just felt he was ready and it was not long before he was showing why. When he set out he was ranked 809th in the world. Now he is No 2 behind Rory McIlroy. In 18 months, he has banked more than $13million (\u00a38.86m) on the PGA Tour alone. In his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says: \u2018I don\u2019t see this as a great run of form, I see this as normal,\u2019 it does not come across as at all boastful. Spieth (right) pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend Annie . Spieth spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister Ellie (centre) and brother Steven (right) Asked about McIlroy, as ever, he found exactly the right words: \u2018He\u2019s got four majors and numerous wins and right now that\u2019s something I can only dream about. I\u2019ll never hit it like he does and I have to make up for that somewhere else. But I\u2019m looking forward to getting in the heat of the moment with him in the near future and testing our games.\u2019 How on earth did golf get this lucky? A sport with a fuddy-duddy, middle-aged image? Consider this: the world\u2019s top two players have an average age seven years younger than the top two in tennis. The game is very fortunate to have a man like McIlroy. It is doubly lucky to have a personable 17-year-old in Lydia Ko at the top of the women\u2019s game. Now Spieth has come along and golf feels truly blessed. Spieth pictured in his younger days playing basketball left-handed . It was with good reason that one of our competitors declared on the eve of the Masters that English golf had reached the end of an era, with no players ranked in the world\u2019s top 10 for the first time at a major since 2008. But, following the encouraging events at Augusta, there should be good days ahead. Three players ranked in the top six was as many as the host nation, with Ian Poulter and Paul Casey (tied sixth) doing enough to suggest they will win at least once each before this season is out. As for joint runner-up Justin Rose, whose 14-under-par total would have won 74 out of 79 Masters, here\u2019s a prediction: over the next five years he will add at least one more major to his 2013 US Open win. England's Justin Rose on the 18th green on Sunday after finishing tied for second on 14-under-par . Driving . No contest here.

It\u2019s still McIlroy for me but we have to remember he is four years older, and Spieth has been a pro for less than two years. The exciting thing for the game, and the frightening thing for everyone else, is they\u2019re both so young in golf terms and clearly only going to get better in years to come.

When asked by Digital Spy about the character Black Widow's flirtations with the other superheroes, Renner responded \"She's a slut,\" and Evans, laughing, added that she is a \"complete whore.\" Joking or not, fans on social media didn't take it lightly. By Thursday, both actors apologized. CNN obtained a statement from Renner saying, \"I am sorry that this tasteless joke about a fictional character offended anyone. It was not meant to be serious in any way. Just poking fun during an exhausting and tedious press tour.\" Evans also released a statement: \"Yesterday we were asked about the rumors that Black Widow wanted to be in a relationship with both Hawkeye and Captain America. We answered in a very juvenile and offensive way that rightfully angered some fans.

He slotted Chelsea ahead in typically composed fashion from the penalty spot before Charlie Adam equalised with an astonishing strike from inside his own half shortly before half time. Stoke continued to make things difficult for Chelsea until an Asmir Begovic error led to Loic Remy tapping in the winner. Here, Sportsmail's Kieran Gill gives his player ratings. CHELSEA (4-2-3-1) Thibaut Courtois \u2013 5.5 . Never called into action in the opening 43 minutes but beaten by Adam with an incredible strike from inside Stoke\u2019s half. Too far off his line and one of the world\u2019s best goalkeepers was left embarrassed. Thibaut Courtois was on the winning team but will want to forget  Charlie Adam beating him from his own half . Gary Cahill (left) and John Terry leap up to block an attempt at goal from Stoke's Philipp Wollscheid . Branislav Ivanovic \u2013 6.5 . Tidied up well on the rare occasion Stoke threatened. Played with more freedom once Chelsea had the lead and tried to help in attack down the wing. Gary Cahill \u2013 6 .5 . Looked cool when called into action and was able to clear the danger as Stoke tried to cross their way into the lead in the second half. John Terry \u2013 7 . Manned the back well and it took a goal-of-the-season contender for his team to concede against a Stoke side that ran out of ideas at times. Always the man that remained at the back to kill off any threat. Cesar Azpilicueta \u2013 6.5 . Tried to get forward and help Hazard down the left. Closed down well and put in a tireless performance. Nemanja Matic \u2013 6 . A few too many misplaced passes and a hurried clearance almost spelled danger for Chelsea. Cleaned up well when needed to win back possession, however. Cesc Fabregas \u2013 7 . Won the penalty with a clever cut back that fooled Wollscheid. Kept the midfield ticking over well. Brazil international Willian (left) also produced an impressive display for Chelsea in the win over Stoke . Eden Hazard put Chelsea into the lead with from the penalty spot in the first half . Diego Costa's (right) game was curtailed 10 minutes after coming on with what looked like a hamstring injury . Willian \u2013 7.5 . A handful for Stoke as he, Oscar and Hazard linked up well to create chances in the first half, though they were never taken. Never short of a run. Oscar \u2013 6.5 . Scuppered one of Chelsea\u2019s best chances to take the lead by placing his shot wide of the far post, and was ultimately \u2013 and unfortunately \u2013 sacrificed for Costa at half time. Eden Hazard \u2013 8.5 . A live wire. Master of the one-two and creating chances. Ultimately kept his cool from the spot to give Chelsea a much-needed lead before Adam\u2019s equaliser. Didn\u2019t look tired, despite his weariness during international break. Assisted the winning goal. Loic Remy - 7.5 . Looked a worthy replacement for Costa as he twice went close to giving Chelsea the lead in the opening seven minutes. Scored in the second half when Mourinho really needed it, and it was deserved. Loic Remy (left) slots in Chelsea's winner against Stoke in the second half at Stamford Bridge . SUBS: . Diego Costa \u2013 6 . Came on but could do no damage as he was forced off with what looked like another hamstring injury. Immediately called to the bench for him to come off after 10 minutes on the field. Didier Drogba \u2013 6 . Replaced Costa after the striker went off with an injury. Had little to do but hold up the ball. Juan Cuadrado \u2013 6 . Little to do but helped Chelsea get over the line. MANAGER: Jose Mourinho \u2013 6.5 . A frustrating afternoon for Mourinho, who was active on the touchline throughout, looking unhappy and muttering to himself. Either way, it worked, and his team added three points to their title charge. Jose Mourinho was active throughout the game on the touchline as Chelsea beat Stoke 2-1 . STOKE CITY (4-4-2) Asmir Begovic \u2013 6.5 . Outstanding one-handed save at full stretch to deny Remy\u2019s deflected shot after less than three minutes. Ultimately took a penalty for Begovic to concede the first. He\u2019d done his homework, going the same way Hazard normally does, but beaten at the other side. His throw was intercepted by Willian which led to Chelsea's winner, though. Geoff Cameron \u2013 5.5 . Given the unwanted task of stopping Hazard on his runs down the left wing on occasion. Ryan Shawcross \u2013 6 . Stayed physical throughout, as per. Captained his team well on a ground that has been unkind to them previously, but ultimately could not help them steal a point. Philipp Wollscheid \u2013 5.5 . Took the bait from Fabregas by sweeping the Spaniard\u2019s feet to give Chelsea a penalty and ultimately the lead. Ryan Shawcross (right) led Stoke well but could not help his side take a point at Stamford Bridge . Wollscheid (right) slides in on Cesc Fabregas to concede a penalty in the first half, from which Hazard scored . Marc Wilson \u2013 5.5 . A little unsure at times, largely down to a lack of communication between him and his team-mates. Stephen Ireland \u2013 6 . Strong in midfield but found it difficult to get involved as that area was dominated by the men in blue. Glenn Whelan \u2013 5.5 . Rightly booked for a late challenge on Fabregas but did not see much of the ball as Chelsea dominated midfield. Steven Nzonzi \u2013 6 . Close with a controlled shot after a poor clearance by Matic and again in the second half as he grazed the far post with a bouncing effort across goal. Could not take the few chances that fell his way. Steven Nzonzi (centre) went close to scoring for Stoke but ultimately did not impose himself on the game . Charlie Adam (second left) is mobbed by his team-mates after his astonishing strike levelled the scores . Charlie Adam \u2013 6.5 . Take a bow, Charlie Adam. Incredible goal as he channelled his inner David Beckham and, noticing Courtois off his line, scored from in his own half. A little anonymous until that moment, but his faults were obliterated with that 66-yard strike. Jonathan Walters \u2013 5.5 . Little joy as Stoke rarely threatened up top but tried to keep them in with a shot and held the ball well on occasion. Closely marked by Terry throughout. Mame Biram Diouf \u2013 5.5 . Failed to make an impact and was substituted after 62 minutes for Arnautovic. Jonathan Walters (left) had little joy for Stoke against Chelsea on Saturday, despite his hard work . Mame Biram Diouf (left) floundered against Chelsea's stern defence at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . SUBS: . Arnautovic \u2013 6 . Too little too late to have an influence. MANAGER: Mark Hughes 5.5 .

{"id": "50bc14f1ce9a8bb43a37d914ac020a5ddbad0337-0", "article": "(CNN)It seems almost silly to be writing about baseball in the context of recent events.  Except it isn't. Last weekend, as Baltimore reacted to the death of Freddie Gray, the young man who died last week from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody, Major League Baseball had a problem on its hands. Saturday's game between the Orioles and Red Sox had gone into extra innings in Camden Yards, with plenty of fans for both teams glued to their seats. Boston fans feel at home in Oriole Park -- a so-called retro urban park built to embrace the luxuries of modern stadiums while maintaining that nostalgic feel -- because much of it was based on Boston's Fenway Park. The Boston faithful are used to being in the heart of a city to watch sports.  But when the Orioles finally pulled out a win in the 10th inning, 36,000 fans remained in their seats. They had been asked to do so by Baltimore officials due to  \"ongoing public safety issues.\" The riots of Baltimore, the peaceful marches of Baltimore, the fury and unrest of Baltimore did not seem to have had much to do with baseball.  But as the always-wise Atlantic magazine writer (and Baltimore native) Ta-Nehisi Coates' take on the situation quickly went viral, it became clear that the Oriole's home stand presented a problem. Monday's game against the Chicago White Sox: postponed less than an hour before the first pitch. Tuesday's game against the White Sox: also postponed. Such action by MLB is not without precedent.  In 1967 in Detroit, the 12th Street riots forced the Tigers to postpone one game and relocate others (to Baltimore, no less).  After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., MLB postponed opening day games out of fear of mob violence.  In the wake of the 1992 verdict in the Rodney King beating, the Los Angeles Dodgers postponed several games.  The entire league went on hiatus in the wake of the terrorism and violence of September 11, 2001. Politics threaten sports all the time.  From the demonstrations against the Brazilian government before last summer's World Cup to the massacre of protesting students days before the Opening Ceremony of the Mexico City Olympics in 1968, sports knows well that it sits within the larger context of the world. Our deep investment in our teams -- beyond the tax dollars that construct the stadiums and the salaries players make (and the profits the owners and sponsors draw) -- is supposed to work to create community, to unify.  Cheering for the home team is supposed to create a sense of belonging. \"It's interesting that I have not yet heard anyone say that baseball or sport can heal this wound,\"  Daniel Nathan, professor of American Studies at Skidmore College and editor of \"Rooting for the Home Team: Sport, Community and Identity\" told me.  \"People did say that in the weeks after 9/11.  This is not 9/11 -- not even close.  But it is a serious social and cultural rupture. Painful.\" What happens next is striking.  After two postponements, the Orioles will play Chicago on Wednesday, but no one else will be invited.  In an unprecedented move by major league baseball, the public is not invited to the final game of the series, moved to the afternoon in accordance with the curfew imposed by Baltimore's mayor. While there are a few examples of fan-less games being played in the United States, none have been for such reasons, while in Europe, there have been a handful of incidents in which soccer teams have been punished for fan behavior with fan-less games. Without fans, does baseball mean anything? When the new Camden Yards made its debut in 1992, people heralded the return of the old-time stadium smack in the middle of the city.  But are the residents of that city ready to reminisce about the so-called good old days? In a recent episode of \"Real Sports,\" Chris Rock delivered a brilliant seven-minute diatribe on the fact that less than 10% of baseball players or fans are black. \"Last year, the San Francisco Giants won it all without any black guys on the team,\" he said. \"The team the Giants had to beat to get there, the St. Louis Cardinals, had no black people. None. How could you ever be in St. Louis and see no black people?\" Rock's thesis?  That baseball's sense of nostalgia encompassed by places like Camden Yards does not sit well with African Americans, whose memories of the old days are anything but good. To his credit, Orioles Executive Vice President John Angelos, son of majority owner Peter Angelos, took to Twitter to prioritize the issues at hand, focusing not on the lost games, but on the \"unfairly impoverished population living under an ever-declining standard of living and suffering at the butt end of an ever-more militarized and aggressive surveillance state.\" Yet as much of America continues to grapple with the idea that black lives matter, it is clear that the country believes sports do matter, whether or not anyone is there to watch. And with MLB's announcement that Baltimore's weekend games will be moved to Tampa, it becomes clear that the only thing that the United States has figured out about race relations, poverty, the achievement gap, police brutality, and so on is how to keep its baseball players safe and make sure that the games go on.", "candidate": "Timothy Stanley: Baltimore rioting had nothing to do with baseball.

Leonie Granger, 25, targeted playboy Mehmet Hassan, 56, after spotting him flashing a roll of \u00a350 notes at a casino in London's West End. The care assistant, from Gillingham, Kent, used her good looks to befriend the poker player, who showered her with gifts, cash and trips to fancy restaurants. Scroll down for video . Aspiring model Leonie Granger (left) has been jailed for 16 years at the Old Bailey after being found guilty of manslaughter over the death of professional gambler Mehmet Hassan (right) who she lured at a casino . Granger (pictured with Mr Hassan at Palm Beach Casino in central London) took advantage of him being a 'soft target', the court heard.\u00a0Judge William Kennedy today described the attack as 'pitiless and wicked' But after going back to his flat with him one night she made her excuses and left the door unlocked so her boyfriend and an accomplice could get inside. They tied up the father of three and kicked him to death as they ransacked his home to find his hidden winnings.\u00a0Afterwards, they left him with multiple broken bones, lying face down in his bedroom drowning in his own blood. Following a trial at the Old Bailey, Granger was found guilty of Mr Hassan's manslaughter by a majority - but not guilty of murder. She was sentenced to 16 years behind bars for the killing by Judge William Kennedy today. Co-defendants Kyrron Jackson, 28, and Nicholas Chandler, 29, were\u00a0found guilty of murder and were jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years. Sentencing, Judge William Kennedy described the attack as 'pitiless and wicked', adding: 'It was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion.' In mitigation, Orlando Pownall QC said Granger had worked with the elderly since she was 18 and had only got involved with the plot because she was in love with Jackson and 'fell in with his desires'. Mr Pownall said she now 'deeply regretted' what had happened, adding: 'Her head was turned by Mr Jackson who she loved and to some extent by Mr Chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming.' But jailing her, the judge said she had been 'deceitful from the outset' and had 'lost her sense and compassion' when she got involved in the scheme. He added that she clearly cared more for Jackson than he cared for her. Granger, from Gillingham, Kent, used her good looks to befriend the poker player, who showered her with gifts, cash and trips to fancy restaurants. She wept in the dock as she was convicted of manslaughter . Granger and Mr Hassan are pictured on CCTV going in to the Palm Beach Casino in central London together . All the defendants were convicted of robbing Mr Hassan and conspiracy to falsely imprison him. Jackson and Chandler, both of south east London, were further found guilty of two counts of plotting to rob employees of Grosvenor Casinos, two counts of conspiracy to have a shotgun and imitation firearm in January last year, and two counts of conspiracy to falsely imprison. The trial had heard how Mr Hassan was oblivious of the sting as he wined and dined the woman he knew as Rachel, even bragging to his friends that he was not paying her to be with him. Granger was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two . After their first date, Granger was overheard by a taxi driver reporting back that Hassan was 'flashy' and saying: 'This guy is a professional gambler. He has never worked a day in his life.' On the night of the murder, Mr Hassan had taken Granger to the top Mayfair restaurant Nobu before going on to the Palm Beach Casino nearby, where he gave her \u00a31,000 in cash to gamble with. Dressed in a strapless top, tight-fitting black trousers, high heels and a large gold necklace, Granger was spotted by a poker supervisor kissing Mr Hassan 'passionately' and she told the pair to 'get a room'. Later, he took her back to his Islington flat where she made her excuses and left in a taxi - but not before letting in her boyfriend Jackson and his friend Chandler, who were poised to strike outside. Using parcel tape, the two men tied up Mr Hassan in his bedroom then kicked him to death and ransacked his home as they searched for his stash of cash. While Mr Hassan's beaten and bloody body lay undiscovered, the killers were filmed on Granger's mobile phone throwing wads of \u00a350 notes around. They fled with \u00a33,000, his TV and mobile phone, but were caught after Granger's phone records were examined. Granger's co-defendants Kyrron Jackson, 28, (left) and Nicholas Chandler, 29, (right), both from south east London, have both been convicted of murdering Mr Hassan and are to be sentenced in due course . Granger (left) helped Kyrron Jackson (centre) and Nicholas Chandler (right) rob and kill gambler Mr Hassan . Police found Mr Hassan lying in a pool of blood after his family had raised the alarm. His knees and ankles were bound and there was a shoe print on his cheek. Investigators found he had suffered a 'vicious and sustained attack' \u2013 probably as his killers demanded to know where he hid his money. Granger's 'soft target' was known to have two favourite casinos in Mayfair - the Playboy Casino on Old Park Lane and the Palm Beach Casino in Berkeley Street. He sometimes won as much as \u00a315,000 at a time and rather than using bank accounts, he would keep his winnings around his flat, even keeping thousands of pounds in his microwave. The fact the divorced father 'enjoyed the company of women' made him particularly 'vulnerable to the unscrupulous', prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors. Chandler is pictured throwing around \u00a350 notes around which he stole from Mr Hassan after killing him . He said Mr Hassan's death was the 'culmination of the ruthless greed' of Jackson and Chandler who had been involved in two armed robberies at the same casino in South Kensington in January and February last year, but with limited success. The jury was shown CCTV film of the dramatic raids as well as clips of Granger and Mr Hassan together in the casino hours before the killing. They were also played a short clip of the three defendants literally throwing the victim's money around hours after the murder, with Jackson wearing a gas mask and stuffing a fist full of notes into his underpants. Speaking after their convictions last week, Mr Hassan's family said his death will 'haunt them forever'. His daughter Stephanie Hassan added: 'Every day we miss him and we love him.'", "candidate": "Leonie Granger, 25, targeted playboy Mehmet Hassan, 56, at a casino.

In another room, my grandfather could not comprehend what was happening and, instead of seeking cover, drifted towards the window. Outside, a brown dust-cloud rose from the ruins of cottages that had dotted the next hill. I was at my uncle's place in Ramkot, west Kathmandu, some 12 kilometers (7.4 miles) east from my family home. After escaping the building for the safety of open air, my first thought was for news of friends and family. Calls didn't go through but thankfully texts and data did. I heard from everyone except my mother. Worried sick, I foolishly went into the house for a second time to get my belongings and leave for home. Another tremor -- the first of many to aftershocks that have continued to strike an already traumatized city -- shook the house. I took refuge under the same doorway. The journey towards my family home in Sifal was a map of quake destruction, with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart. A high wall surrounding a monastery had collapsed and the nuns had run to a nearby field. A mud-and-brick cottage had fallen on a blue motorbike but no trace could be found of its rider. A woman perched on top of rubble tried to reach for a water container from what used to be her kitchen. Everywhere, survivors gathered wherever they could find open space -- fields, private compounds, empty roadside lots. In Chhauni, an ice cream seller ran double-time with his cart, while his radio relayed the latest. Further ahead, a mother and daughter sat down on a pavement so that a grandchild could be fed. Across the Bishnumati River, uphill towards Maru, I ran to get away from the tall houses and made towards the Kathmandu Durbar Area. It was reduced to rubble. A blood donation camp was said to be buried by the same structure that sheltered it. Locals were searching for survivors, but progress was slow. The Kasthamandap temple had caved in. Temples that sat on impressive staircase-style pyramids were now dust. The western fa\u00e7ade of the Basantapur palace had fallen apart and nothing remained of the remained of the nine-story medieval palace nearby. Meanwhile, the curio fleamarket was flooded with people who had made it out of the cramped quarters of Jhocchen, Indra Chowk, New Road, and nearby neighborhoods. In Putalisadak, I met a cousin who was sitting an entrance exam for a prestigious high school when the quake hit before the allotted time was over. He kept wondering out loud whether he could retake the test. The two of us walked through Bagbajar, trying to trace a few acquaintances, and up Dillibajar to Kamalpokhari. A hawker was selling momos -- a Nepalese type of dumpling -- under a seven-story building, while policemen guarded a jailhouse. People gathered mostly in the middle of crossroads, on traffic islands and around metal pulpits, which looked out of range of falling buildings. The aftershocks kept coming. I reached home and found both my parents alive and uninjured. I couldn't believe that our 30-year-old house was still standing. As I walked my cousin to where his parents were, we kept hearing rumors:  \"More quakes forecast by experts for 5 p.m. and midnight.\" As if to confirm, tremors shook us at six and more would follow at 10 p.m. and midnight, with smaller shocks throughout the night. Along the northern boundary of the former royal museum, the wall had collapsed and people had poured out of the Uttar Dhoka neighborhood onto the palace lawn. Green military tents meant for two people were now packed with six and the army was trying hard to accommodate as many as possible. In Thamel, an electricity pole had squashed an abandoned taxi. A few men took turns taking photos with the wrecked car. In Kantipath, a handful of backpackers were discussing where to make camp. Back home, my parents decided against going to the nearby Sifal Chaur football field where families were sleeping on plastic mattresses under rudimentary tents. Instead, their tactic was to stay on the ground floor, be awakened by tremors, and then scamper to a corner of our garden that seemed relatively safe. I did not sleep a wink.", "candidate": "Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, was rocked by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on Tuesday.

The actress and her fiance Ashton Kutcher responded to the impending lawsuit with a tongue-in-cheek video, claiming they were going to file a lawsuit against the accuser Kristina Karo, because of injuries suffered while being forced to watch her music video. On Wednesday the story broke that the 31-year-old was being sued for $5,000 by a woman claiming to be her former childhood friend, who said she suffered emotional trauma when a seven-year-old Kunis stole her pet foul. Fight fire with fire: Mila Kunis has responded to\u00a0Kristina Karo's accusations she stole her chicken as a child, with a video claiming she will counter-sue for injuries sustained while watching Karo's music video . But within hours Kutcher had posted a video - obtained by TMZ - pointing out some of the holes in Karo's story. 'Let's just get this clear: you stole a chicken from a one-month-old child who spoke to you in an entire conversation,' the 37-year-old declares in the self-shot vid. 'It's just shocking to me. Not only did she have a conversation at one-month old in Ukraine, she was speaking English! This is the smartest girl I've ever heard of!' Kunis herself appears on the clip pointing out that it must be 'just coincidental' he accuser has a new music video out, and is trying to launch a singing career here in LA. Foul play: The reason for Karo's lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy . 'I was devastated. I was weeping. I was dumbfounded. I was like \"which chicken did I steal?\" because I was obviosly in the village when I stole these chickens. So I apologise to this woman who was maybe or maybe not a month old,' she said. The Jupiter Ascending star admits that she has yet to be physically served the documents, and then reveals she is preparing her own counter-suit. 'But emotionally I feel served. I would like to launch a counter $5,000 lawsuit for making me sit there and watch you music video, shamelessly. My body hurts. My eyes hurt, they're burning. That requires money.' 'No Green Card for you,' Kutcher admonishes into the camera, in response to her song title plea Give Me Green Card, which currently has almost 170k views on YouTube. The couple then turn semi-serious to address the charges. 'I feel like I will be a chicken fighter for a very long time. I will be an advocate. I would never steal someone else's chicken. I wouldn't, I wouldn't,' Kunis insists. 'Listen folks, I believe this woman, I know her pretty well, I believe that shes an ethical person that wouldn't steal a chicken,' Kutcher adds. 'So you have it right from the horse's... the chicken's mouth.' Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, had being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo. Kutcher pointed out in their response video that their accuser was also one-month old at the time and apparently fluent in English and Ukranian . Pollo loco: In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo had alleged that she was a classmate of Kunis, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. The wannabe singer, now living in Los Angeles, claimed a seven-year-old Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reported. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from\u00a0Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.

That's what happened to cyclist Wang Pingan as he neared the end of a two-wheel trek that covered thousands of miles through every major province in the vast country, according to local media. Arriving in the southern city of Shenzhen, in southern Guandong province, Wang locked up his trusty mountain bike, loaded with panniers, to check out electronics markets in the city's Huaqiangbei area. Within 10 minutes the thieves struck. But here's where the story takes an unexpected turn. Despite police initially saying odds were stacked against the bike ever being recovered, Shenzhen's finest managed to track it down and return it. The Southern Metro News reported that police apprehended an alleged criminal and sent Wang a photo of a bike they recovered. He recognized it instantly. They said the theft, from a road junction \"infested\" by cycle thieves was caught on surveillance cameras. The bike had likely been sold twice before being recovered. \"We don't want this lad visiting Shenzhen and having a bad memory of the city,\" a police spokesman told the paper. Now, with 29,200 kilometers under his tires, Wang can continue the final few days of his epic journey. He'll be able to add his final destination, Hainan Island, to a route that has already taken in some of the country's most far-flung places. Among them are Mohe in Heilongjiang, China's northernmost and coldest place, Urumqi in the west and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the southwest.. Wang, a recent university graduate, who embarked on his trip with a budget of little more than $100, had earlier turned down offers from across China to help him get a new bike, vowing to walk if he couldn't be reunited with his \"old lover.\" \"It has a special meaning to me,\" he said, according to SMN. Before the bike's recovery, Wang had posted a heart-rending tribute to his bike on social media, recalling their adventures together. \"The bicycle itself doesn't have a high value, but spending more than a year with it, it's like a best friend who has accompanied me on my way, and taken me to every place without complaints,\" he writes. \"Thank you, my buddy, maybe I'll never see you again ...

So why are Arsenal destined to sign off from another campaign celebrating a top-four finish and not a serious title challenge? Finish second they may well, but never have they entered the race for the top-flight crown. This term they are simply the best of the ragged rest, each with their flaws which have made the title tussle something of a \u2018no contest\u2019. Arsenal celebrate after a fine strike from Alexis Sanchez put them 3-0 up against Liverpool on Saturday . This is the most impressive team the Gunners have boasted since the dying embers of the Invincibles side of more than a decade ago. They have pace, power, energy and invention in attack \u2013 and that is just Alexis Sanchez. At the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since New Year\u2019s Day. But their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them, again. This year, however, is a reverse of previous seasons. More recently we have built up Arsene Wenger\u2019s side as title challengers until the arrival of spring, only for it all to fall flat. Arsene Wenger watches on as his side cruise to a stylish win over their rivals for a top-four spot . This time, it is a stuttering start which has undermined their progress. By mid-October they had already dropped 13 points. There was talk of Wenger not even seeing the season out, let alone extending his stay into next term and beyond. But is the long-serving Frenchman finally about to hit upon a team which, given the manner in which they\u2019re finishing this campaign, could well be installed as title favourites come August? Should Wenger strengthen in key areas then they would surely be vying for such status at the head of the market. He needs no more Mesut Ozils, no more Santi Cazorlas or Tomas Rosickys. Rather, he needs a new spine and characters with backbone. Mesut Ozil celebrates his goal on Saturday as the German World Cup winner continued his fine form . A central defender, central midfielder and centre forward need to arrive if this current vintage is to avoid going the same way as those who have promised so much yet delivered so little in recent years. Interestingly, Wenger\u2019s policy of chasing the best British talent could be on the way out. Yes, there was the capture of Danny Welbeck last summer, but that was more opportunistic than a long-term pursuit. Welbeck, in turn, has netted just four league goals and watched from the bench as Liverpool were torn apart. So, too, did Theo Walcott. He has the mitigation of injury, of course, but does Wenger trust him to remain fit for an entire campaign? Likewise, Jack Wilshere. Teams which win titles have players who, in short, play. Jack Wilshere (centre) watches on from the stands on Saturday after missing out through injury . Theo Walcott (left) has struggled since returning from a year-long injury lay-off . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey have both started just 17 of 31 league games. For the latter, a return of four goals is a sorry show given the 16 he plundered last season. So while there is the promise of better times ahead, issues remain for Wenger to sort. You feel he is finally on the cusp of something exciting at the Emirates. But then we have been there before and it ultimately ends in the celebration of failure. Wenger needs to think big this summer, or else goodwill from frustrated fans could be in short supply.", "candidate": "Arsenal beat Liverpool 3-0 in their Premier League clash on Saturday.

Layton Ndukwu had given Leicester hope of clawing back the advantage with 20 minutes to go but substitute Buckley and Barker struck to kill that dream off and set up a final against Chelsea later this month. City will face Chelsea at a venue, likely to to be the City Football Academy Stadium, in the first leg on April 20 before travelling to Stamford Bridge a week later on April 27.

Unused subs: Albinson, Fernandes, Dilrosun . Bookings: Wood, Bryan, Angelino . With City holding a big advantage from the first leg last month, this clash always looked difficult for Leicester, and their inability to find an early goal made the task of overhauling the advantage even tougher. City were the better team for much of the first half but goalkeeper Kjetil Haug had to be aware to keep out Hamza Choudhury from close range at the other end. That was their best chance until Charlie Oliver handled inside his own penalty area with 20 minutes to go to gift Ndukwu the chance to give the home side the lead. That opportunity was one he gratefully accepted, confidently dispatching his spot-kick past Haug. Layton Ndukwu of Leicester City scores from a penalty to cut the deficit but it was not Leicester's night . Brandon Barker (right) scored City's second goal of the evening as they made it to a first final in seven years . Despite still holding a decent lead, City surged forward in response and Buckley equalised, thumping home Barker's cross. And Buckley effectively returned the favour when he was hauled down inside the area moments later to allow Barker to make it 5-1 on aggregate from the spot.

From looking as if a door had been slammed shut on them, Liverpool, unexpectedly, have a chance to kick it back open and capitalise. When Liverpool\u2019s players trudged from the Emirates Stadium pitch, having been pummelled into submission by Arsenal, all hope of a top-four finish looked to have evaporated. Brendan Rodgers, subdued and disconsolate, admitted as much in his post-match debrief. The Rodgers who left London nine days ago is very different, though, to the Rodgers who will step into Anfield\u2019s technical area on Monday, feeling optimistic and satisfied with his lot. He knows Liverpool have been let off the hook and now he wants to see a response. Liverpool's first-team players will be all smiles if they can finish inside the top four and win the FA Cup . Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling arrives at Anfield eight hours ahead of Monday night's match at Anfield . Dejan Lovren will be hoping to keep his place after appearing in Liverpool's win over Blackburn . Jordon Ibe removes a suit from the boot of his car as he begins to prepare for his side's league match . Liverpool are seven points behind fourth-placed Manchester City but have a game in hand on their rivals . Had Manchester City won their games against Crystal Palace and Manchester United, talk of Liverpool being Champions League contenders would have been risible but the implosion at the Etihad Stadium has thrown things wide open. At present, the gap between Liverpool and City is seven points \u2013 and, just like last year when the two teams were duelling, Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side have a significantly better goal difference \u2013 but Rodgers will be telling his squad that it is not insurmountable. Given the way City are playing, there are a number of games that could cause them issues on the climb to the line \u2013 will Aston Villa and QPR be straightforward? How about Tottenham away? Does Pellegrini retain his squad\u2019s belief? \u2013 and now is the moment Liverpool must pounce. In the next seven days, the way Liverpool\u2019s campaign is viewed could be completely transformed. Beat Newcastle and they will believe they can hunt City down; see off Villa at Wembley and they will have a fine chance of winning the FA Cup. Rickie Lambert, pictured making his way into Anfield, has failed to hit the back of the net in his last six games . Reds boss Brendan Rodgers will be hoping his side can get back to winning ways in the Premier League . Sterling and his Liverpool team-mates were left dejected after their 4-1 defeat by Arsenal . So now the question will be asked of Rodgers\u2019 squad: can they ramp up the pressure? There have been occasions this season when they have faltered at crucial moments \u2013 think home games against Basle (Champions League), Manchester United (Premier League) \u2013 and there can be no repeat. Here lies an opportunity for Raheem Sterling to dispel the furore around his contract saga with some jet-propelled performances, for Daniel Sturridge to remind a wider audience of his goalscoring ability and for Philippe Coutinho to sparkle and shine. Coutinho has won John Terry\u2019s vote to be the player of the year. It was quite a statement from the Chelsea captain but there is little doubt that the Brazilian has the ability to be one of the top draws in the Premier League. These two games should be made for him. If Coutinho starts pulling the strings against Newcastle, Liverpool will get the result that will ensure Manchester City feel their breath on their necks and you would think the wide open spaces of Wembley would be tailor-made for his passing game. Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho helped his side progress to the semi-finals of the FA Cup . Rodgers talks tactics with his coaching staff ahead of his side's Premier League showdown with Newcastle . \u2018He is a young player that's come into this country and adapted incredibly well to the style of football in the Premier League,\u2019 said Rodgers. \u2018People initially maybe thought he might be a bit slight. But he is very strong in his mind and he\u2019s got an incredible technique, up there with world's best. 'With him it's about the consistency. He played in a different position the other night against Blackburn, we asked him tactically to operate different and he carried that out very, very well. So great tactical discipline and obviously a wonderful goal. \u2018His best years are way ahead of him. He's such a humble boy, he wants to train and loves his football every day. John's probably looking at his performance level; since he's been here it has been outstanding and is only going to get better which is the pleasing thing for everyone.\u2019 Rodgers\u2019 ambition all year has been to win a trophy. If he was also to steer Liverpool into a top-four spot, it would arguably represent an even better campaign than last year when they came within two points of ending their 25-year quest to become champions of England. To realise that ambition, however, Rodgers needs two wins.

Since Barbie's style\u00a0Instagram account launched last August, swarms of fashion lovers have become fans of her 'official style feed', watching as the Mattel icon models an impressive collection of Barbie clothes that even includes pieces by top designers. Racked recently got the behind-the-scenes scoop on all the outfit changes, international trips, and VIP invites that go into producing the doll's hugely popular page. Pretty popular: Barbie's style-centric Instagram account, @BarbieStyle, is painstakingly planned - and now has three quarters of a million followers . Wow-worthy wardrobe: Barbie has 'thousands' of pieces, most of which are one-of-a-kind and made especially for her Instagram account by the brand's director of design . The idea for  Barbie's fashion-focused Instagram page came to be when Barbie's vice president of design, Kim Culmone, realized that in addition to the official @Barbie account - which promotes the brand's products - the doll could also be presented in a more editorial way, taking inspiration from fashion magazines. The page for @BarbieStyle, she told Racked, tells the story of Barbie's role in pop culture today as a 'contemporary girl with an aspirational lifestyle'. Unlike the main Barbie account that targets children and parents, @BarbieStyle aims to attract trendy twentysomethings - so instead of mermaid and princess costumes, followers get fashion-forward outfits 'firmly rooted in reality'. Along with Barbie director of design Robert Best and Zlatan Zukanovic, the account's creative and photography lead, Ms. Culmone soon grew @BarbieStyle to have even more fans than the original @Barbie page, which has 434,000 followers. Chic at Coachella: Barbie travels to buzzed-about events like Coachella, pictured here, with friends, Ken, and sometimes even her dog . Fashion week regular: The @BarbieStyle account captioned this photo in front of the London Eye: 'Just landed in London...the best way to cure jet lag? Hit the city for the sights and fresh air!' Total jetsetter: The account's creators really pose Barbie in front of famous landmarks - not pictures or green screens - including Notre-Dame, left, and La Belle Epoque restaurant, right, in Paris . But @BarbieStyle doesn't just have more followers than @Barbie - this doll also has a much more glamorous life, juggling trips to Paris with shopping sprees rather than multiple careers as an astronaut, pastry chef, and lifeguard. She also has an entourage to take her wherever she goes.\u00a0Some combination of Ms. Culmone, Mr. Best, and Mr. Zukanovic travel to each location that Barbie visits, including London, Paris, and New York for Fashion week, California for Coachella, and Miami, Florida for Art Basel. Once she arrives, Barbie gets the star\u00a0treatment: Mr. Best creates almost every one-of-a-kind piece Barbie wears and uses a professional camera, not a smartphone,\u00a0to take the shots. 'She travels with an entire wardrobe,' Ms. Culmone said. 'Thousands of accessories! Ken and her friends and her puppy come too - she does have an entourage.' Mr. Best added: 'We pretend she\u2019s a little person going to do all these things, so we think, \"How would she do them? What would she wear? What would her point of view be?\" If Barbie\u2019s like our celebrity and we\u2019re her team, you don\u2019t want her to falter!' Party hopping: This photo of Barbie in a glamorous gown was captioned: 'Kicking off this #GoldenGlobes weekend at the #WMagShootingStars event. Thanks for having me @wmag & @hugoboss!

{"id": "83d6436741b1022766c9baa31ffc00748fa415ec-0", "article": "(CNN)On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled \"Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,\" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \"what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,\" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans \"targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction.\" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book \"Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,\" notes, \"the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems.\" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? \"Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!\" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. \"This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it.\" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage.

The West Ham star has had a fine debut season in the Premier League, with a number of big clubs circling him for a possible summer move. But Allardyce believes that City's previous British purchases speak volumes and that the 25-year-old should remain where he is. Aaron Cresswell (left) has been linked with a move to Manchester City but Sam Allardyce has warned him . He wrote in his Evening Standard column: 'What makes players like him attractive to big clubs is that he is home-grown and squads must have eight of those in the Premier League. 'Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair, for example, both spent time at City but did not play a great deal. 'They're featuring more regularly now, for Sunderland and on loan at Aston Villa respectively, but the decision for a player like Sinclair is would he be willing to join another club on a permanent deal if it meant less money?' The left back scored a stunning free-kick last weekend against Stoke, as he showed his attacking prowess, as well as his defensive solidity. It remains to be seen if Cresswell will be at the club next season but with an England call-up being touted, West Ham may face a tough task of keeping their prized asset.

{"id": "c484fc4636acdcd19c27baa6716ad9c805060a19-0", "article": "(CNN)I will always remember when things turned. I was 12 years old, and my younger sister and I were with our parents attending a peaceful demonstration in downtown Miami near the courthouse. We were there to protest the acquittal of four police officers in the beating death of unarmed motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie. I had learned the word \"acquittal\" just that day. It meant they wouldn't be held responsible. Community leaders were gathered at the front, speaking to a crowd that was in shock and full of anger and despair. The trial had been covered extensively, and nobody could believe that the fatal beating -- with the extent of the physical wounds to McDuffie's head and body -- could be justified or excused. I started to hear rumblings coming from around the perimeter of the immediate crowd. There was shouting and cursing. Bottle throwing. Then a car was turned over and set on fire. That was Miami 35 years ago, but it could just as easily have been Baltimore this week. The Miami riots of 1980 were the first major \"race riots\" since the wave of riots spread across the nation in the 1960s. Harlem 1964: Police shooting of 15-year-old James Powell. Watts 1965: Arrest of 21-year-old Marquette Frye for drunken driving. Newark 1967: Police beating of John Smith while under arrest. Detroit 1967: Police raid on a \"blind pig\" after-hours bar. Then the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, and Baltimore and 125 other cities erupted in flames. The immediate catalysts for the waves of riots in the 1960s before the death of Dr. King were police action, or, more specifically, perceived unjust police action. That was true in Miami in 1980 after the acquittal of the police officers. And the same in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers for the beating of motorist Rodney King. Wednesday marks the 23rd anniversary of the start of the Los Angeles riots. And now we have Baltimore 2015, with the death of suspect Freddie Gray in police custody. My parents were leaders and participants in the nonviolent civil rights movement, and they raised me to understand that youths were the key to the movement. It was the images of young people all over the country -- often facing physical danger, discipline from their parents and suspension from school -- that propelled the civil rights movement into the national spotlight. Juxtapose decades-old images of youths being hosed down by police during nonviolent demonstrations in Birmingham and Selma with Tuesday's images of Baltimore youths throwing rocks at police, and you wonder what has happened. As a 12-year-old girl in Miami, I didn't understand how people could injure and even kill others and destroy their neighborhoods, and risk going to jail, by rioting. I was afraid because I didn't see my father for days as he and other community leaders walked the streets to try to restore calm. I was also afraid that such senseless violence could only derail the legitimate causes of the African-American community, causes historically advanced by nonviolent civil disobedience and through legislative channels. But two months ago, I agreed to moderate a panel at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights called \"Riot -- The Voice of the Unheard?\" The occasion was to mark the Atlanta premiere of \"Detroit '67,\" a play written by Dominique Morisseau and directed by Kamilah Forbes that chronicled the journey of a family as they lived through the turmoil of the Detroit '67 riot, including the joy and love they found with one another. The play and the panel were programmed by Kenny Leon's True Colors Theatre Company, a nonprofit devoted to presenting artistic interpretations with diverse voices so that individuals and institutions can have a shared platform in their quest for understanding in American society. Inspired by the mission, I had recently joined the board. Although pegged to the past, the purpose of the panel was to examine how current events relating to police actions against African-American men could potentially lead to rioting and what could be done to prevent it. I learned that some questioned whether riots are actually purposeless and uncontrolled violence, or whether they are purposeful uprisings against individuals and institutions. I learned that those who participate in riots often feel hopeless and dehumanized, both as the victims of police action against them that triggered the riots and as perpetrators of violence during riots. I learned that riots in the 1960s played a role in advancing the civil rights agenda, often by galvanizing local and national government officials to work with peaceful community, church and civil rights leaders to address the root causes of riots. This is a controversial part of our civil rights history that has been sanitized. At the conclusion of the 1967 Detroit riot, President Lyndon Johnson condemned the violence but said in his address to the nation that: \"This is not a time for angry reaction. It is a time for action, starting with legislative action to improve the life in our cities. The strength and promise of the law are the surest remedies for tragedy in the street. ...\" His administration convened the Kerner Commission to examine the 1965-68 riots, and its findings were that racism had led to joblessness, poverty, a lack of political power, unfair housing, police brutality and inferior schools. After the beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, the Christopher Commission was established and concluded that racial profiling and excessive force, unjust treatment in the criminal justice system, poor housing, and the lack of jobs and education were triggers for the riots. After all of these riots, the affected city, state and national governments enacted plans and programs to address some of these underlying conditions. Maybe the Baltimore youths involved in the riots felt the way one youth did in Watts in 1965. As recounted in \"The Great Rebellion\" by Kenneth Stahl, Dr. King went to Watts to try to calm tensions, and a hostile youth said to him:  \"We won.\" King challenged him: \"How have you won? Homes are destroyed, blacks are dead in the streets, stores you shop from for food and clothes are destroyed.\" The young man replied, \"We won because we made the whole world pay attention ... the police chief and mayor had never been here. We made them come.\" Dr. King would say near the end of his life: \"It is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.\" When I learned that Baltimore high school students planned a purge based on the movie \"The Purge,\" in which people were legally absolved for their anarchistic crimes, it suddenly made sense. They thought they wouldn't be held responsible for their crimes. They thought they would be absolved -- a word not much different from the word \"acquitted\" I learned the day of the Miami riots. But they got it wrong. They will forever live the repercussions of their actions, regardless of the impetus. But the Rev. Jamal Bryant got it right when he said he would open his Empowerment Temple AME Church in Baltimore to youths who would not be in school so he could teach them the power of nonviolence to change society. That power was evident after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the decision not to indict the officer who killed him. Those protests were mostly peaceful. And the government responded -- not out of fear of violence, but because of a desire to change the conditions that led to the protests. After several months of investigation, the far-reaching Justice Department report on Ferguson issued in March concluded that the use of policing to raise revenue, combined with a systemic racial bias, had led to a pattern and practice of discrimination and Fourth, 14th, Sixth and First Amendment rights violations against African-Americans in Ferguson. The report made recommendations that the Ferguson Police Department, as well as other departments across the country, should enact to improve police relations in communities of color. The riots in Baltimore have rightfully been quashed, but the voices of nonviolent protesters continue to be heard.", "candidate": "LZ Granderson was 12 years old when she witnessed riots in Miami.

Helen Flanagan stepped out recently to show off her burgeoning bump in a slinky clinging dress, red lips and heels, confirming that when it comes to maternity style there are distinctive camps. Scroll down for video . Helen Flanagan, 24, looked uncharacteristically demure as she stepped out recently in a floral midi dress . Some pregnant women will choose comfort over style, realising that it's a time when their bodies are changing drastically. Other women will use the opportunity as a time to complete transform the way they dress and choose to showcase a softer, more demure side to themselves. While others will simply continue with their glamorous pre-maternity wardrobes, choosing to ignore the fact they're pregnant. Read on to discover the different maternity styles that celebrities are opting for... SCANTILY CLAD TO COVERED UP . Then and now: Helen Flanagan has changed her style dramatically for the birth of her first child . Danielle Lloyd, 31, is another star who modified her wardrobe for the pregnancy of her third child in 2013 . Many women give their style an overhaul when pregnant, opting for more reserved styles, which very much differ from their trashier previous looks. Helen Flanagan is a prime example of a celebrity who has completely transformed her style since she revealed she was pregnant. The 24-year-old Coronation street actress revealed she was pregnant with 26-year-old footballer Scott Sinclair's child in December 2014. Flanagan was known previously for her revealing style, regularly wearing skin-tight cleavage-exposing dresses and tottering heels, but the actress has recently began to step out in longer, more modest outfits. Glamour model Danielle Lloyd, 31, is another star who modified her wardrobe for the pregnancy of her third child, George, with ex-husband, footballer Jamie O'Hara in 2013. The former Miss England previously sported a wardrobe of thigh-skimming dresses and platforms, but opted for more demure looks leading up to the birth of her child. These included maxi-dresses which also covered up her chest. FLOWY BOHO . Actress Blake Lively, 27, was the epitome of flowy boho maternity style, sporting a series of long maxi-dresses when she was pregnant . The blonde wore a white gown that managed to show off her changing figure in a flattering fashion .

Blake Lively, 27, received much adoration recently for her flawless maternity style, when she was pregnant with her first child with Ryan Reynolds, 38. The 27-year-old actress, who was expecting her daughter James with actor Ryan Reynolds, 38, opted for floaty maxi-dresses. Blake, who gave birth to her daughter in December of last year, opted for chiffon materials and elongated silhouettes beforehand. World-renowned actress Angelina Jolie, also adopted this style during her pregnancy with twins Vivienne and Knox, back in 2008. The star, married to Brad Pitt, chose dresses that gave her growing baby bump lots of space while maintaining a feminine look. BUTTONED UP . Kate Middleton, 33, is the queen of the buttoned-up maternity look, sporting a series of coats leading up to the birth of the second royal baby . Holly Willoughby, 34, also opted for a covered-up and reserved look during the pregnancy of her third child, Chester, in 2014 . It's also understandable that many women will want to cover up completely, or opt for safe knee-length dresses. Kate Middleton, 33, is the queen of buttoned-up maternity style, opting for long coats that cover her baby bump, or dresses that are reserved and contained. The Duchess of Cambridge is expecting her second baby in the next week with Prince William. Presenter Holly Willoughby, 34, was another celebrity to choose modest outfits, during her pregnancy with her third child, Chester, with husband Dan Baldwin in 2014. The This Morning co-host opted for a series of knee-length dresses with flattering twist-fronts or comfy jersey frocks with an empire waist giving her bump plenty of room. ROCK 'N' ROLL MAMA . Despite sporting a huge baby bump, songstress Gwen Stefani, 45, was able to keep her rock-glam edge during her pregnancy in 2014 . Radio and TV presenter Fearne Cotton, 33, is another star who managed to maintain her covetable edgy style during pregnancy . Even when carrying a child and subject to uncontrollable bodily changes, some women maintain their rock-glam edge. Singer Gwen Stefani, 45, is well-known for her punky style, which she managed to preserve during her pregnancy with her and Gavin Rossdale's third child, Apollo in 2014. The feisty songstress was still regularly seen out in leather trousers, sunglasses and denim jackets, even while heavily pregnant. Radio and TV presenter Fearne Cotton, 33, is another star who managed to maintain her covetable edgy style during pregnancy. During her pregnancy with her first child, Rex, the presenter was seen sporting on-trend pieces, such as chunky boots, lace dresses and block print sweaters.

COMFORT OVER STYLE . Mila Kunis, 31, is another actress that had no problem with being seen out in public in casual comfortable clothing during her pregnancy . A huge majority of women will understandably opt for comfort over style. Keira Knightley's off-duty pregnancy style is based around loose, baggy attire - but without losing her hipster edge. The 33-year-old recently announced in December of last year that she is pregnant with her first child with husband and musician James Righton. The actress has been spotted out in dungarees, loose knit jumpers and beanie hats, making warmth and ease a priority. Mila Kunis, 31, is another actress who had no problem with being seen out in public in casual comfortable clothing during her pregnancy with daughter Wyatt.

DRESS LIKE YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT AT ALL . Reality star, Kim Kardashian, 34, was well-known for maintaining her glamorous style and tight-fitting clothing during her pregnancy with child North-West in 2013 . While many women will accept that their body will be subject to changes during pregnancy and will perhaps opt for more sensible footwear and looser clothing, others will try and ignore the changes all together. Reality star, Kim Kardashian, 34, was well-known for maintaining her glamorous style and tight-fitting clothing during her pregnancy with child North West. Kim gave birth to her child with rapper Kanye West in June 2013, but stepped out in more than a few suspect items of clothing during her pregnancy.

In the end it was a different but familiar name who won the Grand National on Saturday. 25-1 outsider Many Clouds, who had shown little form going into the race, won by a length and a half, ridden by jockey Leighton Aspell. Aspell won last year's Grand National too, making him the first jockey since the 1950s to ride back-to-back winners on different horses. \"It feels wonderful, I asked big questions,\" Aspell said of Many Clouds, moments after his victory. \"Over the fences he was awesome. I was just hoping his batteries would last and they did,\" he added. No fairytale . Yet for much of the Grand National -- arguably the world's most famous and certainly the sport's most prestigious jump race -- it looked as if AP McCoy was about to write an ending befitting the career of a man who has dominated jump racing for two decades. His horse Shutthefrontdoor was in the leading group as it negotiated the likes for Becher's Brooke and The Chair, some of the toughest jumps in racing. Last week the 40-year-old Ulsterman, who has won an astonishing 4,356 races, announced he would retire if he won the Grand National for the second time in his career. Shutthefrontdoor was heavily backed by the betting public sensing a storybook conclusion to McCoy's career. UK and Irish betting firms even predicted they would lose as much as $73 million if McCoy won. He was well placed going into the final straight but just couldn't keep up after Many Clouds cut lose, and finished back in fifth. Third time winner . But for Trevor Hemmings, the owner of Many Clouds, it was his third victory in the Grand National. \"I always dreamed of winning my first National,\" a shocked Hemmings told Channel 4. \"Then along comes a second. That's special. And when a third comes along, it's such a wonderful, wonderful feeling.\" Hemming went on to praise Aspell's performance. \"This morning talking we talked about the achievers,\" said Hemmings. \"They are quiet, confident and experienced. He has all of them.\" McCoy's fifth placed finish means he will race again at least once more, in two weeks time at Sandown.", "candidate": "25-1 outsider Many Clouds wins the Grand National on Saturday.

Although that was not the only thing cracked in this game. Graziano Pelle was given a yellow card by referee Kevin Friend in the first half for a clash with Alex Bruce but the Hull City manager could not believe the Southampton striker remained on the field. \u2018Alex has got a horribly broken nose,\u2019 Bruce revealed. \u2018The boy Pelle gets a yellow card but we\u2019re incensed. We need a break like that - not a broken nose, but a break. A decision like that which goes out way.

Hull City goalkeeper Steve Harper can do nothing to stop Pelle's strike despite his best efforts as Southampton made sure of the victory . The Italian striker celebrates with his team-mates after scoring his first Premier League goal since December . \u2018I had a conversation with the referee who said he\u2019s seen a hand in the air. If he\u2019s seen a forearm smash in Alex\u2019s face you do wonder. Pelle\u2019s got away with it, from what I\u2019ve seen from the DVD he meant it.\u2019 To compound Bruce\u2019s misery, Pelle went on to seal the victory in the 81st minute, finishing off a good passing move to score his first league goal since December 20, ending a drought of 1,245 minutes. \u2018It will help him a lot,\u2019 Southampton manager Ronald Koeman said. \u2018December was a long time ago.

Harper dives in vain as Ward-Prowse sends his spot kick to the former Newcastle man's left with unerring precision . The England Under 21 midfielder pumps his fists in celebration after finding the net at St Mary's on Saturday . James Ward-Prowse had put the home side in front, coming on at half-time to convert a penalty 10 minutes later. Shane Long, Whippet-like with his tireless running down either flank, had won the spot kick by racing down the right before being chopped down by Bruce - perhaps somewhat dazed and confused from his blow to the face - inside the box and Ward-Prowse calmly placed it beyond Steve Harper\u2019s reach into the right of goal for his first of the campaign. There was almost an incident when Sadio Mane initially picked the ball up to take the kick. \u2018I had to shout to our captain Jose Fonte to stop Mane,\u2019 Koeman admitted. \u2018It was a difficult situation. James Ward-Prowse and Dusan Tadic are our first and second choice to take penalties. It\u2019s a problem with Mane, but the rules in the team are more important.\u2019 The home side had been fortunate to still be level, two minutes before they scored. Sone Aluko held the ball up on the edge of the box and laid off to Jake Livermore whose powerful shot almost caught out Southampton goalkeeper Kelvin Davis only for him to keep it out one-handed. On the hour mark, only one behind, Hull\u2019s James Chester had Davis beaten with a glancing header from a corner only for Ryan Bertrand to clear off the line. Before kick off, the omens were not good for the visitors who had not won away to Southampton since February 1951 and the 64-year wait to amend that will go on. Two home wins against relegation rivals Aston Villa and Queens Park Rangers in mid-February left them full of hope and optimism of surviving the season. But since then they have not won in six and this was the fourth defeat of that barren spell. Ward-Prowse is congratulated by team-mates Steven Davis and Sadio Mane after his goal gave Ronald Koeman's side the lead .

They have a fortnight break - not involved in FA Cup action next weekend - then six games to save their season, including daunting home matches against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United. Conversely, with Tottenham losing to Aston Villa and Liverpool set to play against Newcastle on Monday, Southampton jumped to fifth. \u2018It will be a fight between Liverpool, Tottenham and Southampton,\u2019 Koeman said. For Bruce and his players, it will be a fight to keep from falling over the relegation precipice.

The Crystal Palace boss would not admit as much, but the grin he wore in the wake of Yannick Bolasie's hat-trick goal told of his satisfaction. Four times on the spin he suffered defeat as Newcastle manager in Tyne-Wear derbies. It was a ruinous run which fractured his relationship with the club's fans and contributed towards his decision to quit Tyneside for south London in January.

Bolasie sprints away in celebration having scored a second-half hat-trick in just over 10 minutes at the Stadium of Light on Saturday afternoon . This was his first trip back to the North East and boy did he enjoy it. Palace now have 25 points from a possible 36 under his care and the table for 2015 alone has the Eagles soaring in fifth, two points behind champions elect Chelsea. His team were devastating on Saturday, a ruthless and unforgiving frontline of Bolasie, Glenn Murray, Jason Puncheon and Wilfried Zaha proving too powerful and too fast for a Black Cats defence which is fast running out of lives. Dick Advocaat was perhaps wishing he had remained in Holland as he watched them surrender to four goals inside 17 minutes at the start of the second half.

James McArthur challenges Black Cats striker Connor Wickham at the Stadium of Light as Crystal Palace stormed to victory . Last weekend he was celebrating a Tyne-Wear derby victory and there was talk of him extending his stay beyond the end of this season. Sunderland, though, are heading for the Championship and Advocaat's reputation is on the line. Pardew's standing, however, has never been higher. He resisted temptation to crow over the identity of the victims and instead hailed the players who have now won four on the bounce. 'We were excellent. We were almost unplayable,' said Pardew. 'We're a team that is bang in form and as a manager you can only be so proud. The scoreline flattered Sunderland a little bit. That front quartet were irresistible at times. We are an honest group with that pace and power and that makes us a very dangerous team.' Bolasie's treble bettered his total from the entirety of this campaign. And Pardew added: 'I'm surprised he hasn't scored more goals. He's the first Palace player to get a Premier League hat-trick as well, so that is a surprise. 'He's at an age where he is improving. The final moment still needs to improve but he was excellent in that respect here.'

Advocaat had watched from home in Holland four weeks ago as Aston Villa won 4-0 at the Stadium of Light. This latest collapse leaves them just two places and three points above the drop zone. And the new boss said: 'I was shocked. You can see what can change in just six days. We were not in the game. Even in the first half Palace were better. 'We gave it all away inside just seven minutes. The work-rate from their strikers and the pace they have made it very difficult. We did not create any chances. That is a big concern. 'But I knew when I started this job that it would be difficult. We still have six games. We can still stay up. We need to get our confidence back.' Bolasie made a point to go and celebrate with Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew after his quick-fire hat-trick during the 4-1 victory . Sunderland strikers Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe can't hide their disappointment having been comprehensively beaten on Saturday . The first half had been a depressing demonstration of two sides fouling one another, an occasional half-chance punctuating the boredom. Jack Rodwell lunged recklessly into the leg of James McArthur with the ball long gone and was lucky to see just yellow. We did see red moments later, albeit the blood streaming from Costel Pantilimon's mouth after Scott Dann planted his boot in the goalkeeper's face when competing for a loose ball. Dann, in fairness, was unfortunate to be booked. And the game soon had its third caution when Lee Cattermole, having been robbed by Bolasie on halfway, desperately hauled the forward back by the trim of his shirt. Palace, though, broke the tedium with their early blitz after the break. Bolasie was the provider for the opener when his cross was deflected onto the brow of Murray, who planted home from four yards for his sixth goal in as many matches.

Within three minutes the livewire Congolese had his first. Dann loaded a ball forward from his own half, Murray rose to flick on and Bolasie escaped to poke through Pantilimon. The visitors were three in front come the 54th minute, and again a long ball proved Sunderland's undoing as Bolasie pounced to rob the dithering John O'Shea before lifting over Pantilimon. He did not have to wait long for his hat-trick. Palace broke through Murray down the right and he squared for Bolasie who, after out-scrapping Pantilimon and Santiago Vergini, poked home for his first senior treble. Sunderland did steal a barely deserved consolation when Connor Wickham turned in Patrick Van Aanholt's cross, but it mattered not and news of Leicester and Aston Villa's victories has them looking down once more.

After a first win in eight, they are back in this consuming promotion race and that six-week wobble is no longer. Steele lapped up the adulation, entertaining 4,000 behind one goal of the DW Stadium at which the Rams wrapped up three crucial points. This felt very important indeed, the outpouring of each ol\u00e9 obvious. Derby's players celebrate after Chris Martin's goal gave them the lead in the second half . Steve McClaren was all smiles as he took his place in the stands before the game .

Make no mistake, these have been tough times for Steve McClaren. Top of the tree back on February 24, the Derby manager is now only looking at promotion via the play-offs, labelling an automatic spot a \u2018long shot\u2019. Their ticket for those extra games is by no means booked, but goals from substitute Chris Martin and Darren Bent mean they are back on track. Martin climbed off the bench at half-time to change the game, slamming in the opener six minutes after the restart before Bent capitalised on shambolic defending to prod in a late second. \u2018I didn\u2019t think Chris would make the impact that he did,\u2019 McClaren admitted after Martin\u2019s first appearance in almost two months. \u2018He could only play 45 minutes. \u2018It\u2019s a massive win. Huge character. We showed the quality we\u2019ve been missing. The away following was absolutely incredible. We\u2019ve stuck together.\u2019 Wigan, by contrast, are staring at relegation and a first season in the third tier since 2003. Now eight points adrift, their fans chanted for the head of Malky Mackay. Chairman David Sharpe didn\u2019t know where to look at full-time and they need two wins from trips to Fulham and Millwall - on Friday and next Tuesday respectively - to stand any chance of survival. Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant does well to tip over a header from a Wigan corner . Derby winger Tom Ince has a low effort saved by Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi . Jeff Hendrick rides a challenge from South Korea international Kim Bo-kyung . \u2018It\u2019s still mathematically possible and we need to keep giving it everything we\u2019ve got,\u2019 Mackay said. \u2018It was criminal to miss those chances but that has haunted the club all season. \u2018I thought we were terrific first half - 17 crosses into their box. That should bring a return of two goals.\u2019 It did not, and Mackay\u2019s use of \u2018mathematical\u2019 tends to suggest the writing is on the wall. James McClean and Kim Bo-kyung both went close but Wigan ran out of steam, their fans streaming out after Bent\u2019s 81st-minute clincher. Kim shifted the ball to his left foot and found James McClean, storming towards the six-yard box but the winger\u2019s bullet header was met in stature by Lee Grant\u2019s splendid one-handed stop, tipping over while airborne. Tom Ince had the beating of his man inside the box, but could only fluff right-footed straight at Ali Al Habsi. Maguire almost put through his own net from a Jamie Ward corner but those two moments were all McClaren\u2019s side could muster before the break, finding the quagmire of a playing surface at the DW Stadium quite a deterrent. This had been used for the Warriors\u2019 win against St Helens in their Rugby League encounter on Good Friday, and you could tell; a tame Kim drive bobbled three times to test Grant when otherwise it would not have. But, frankly, that is the least of Wigan\u2019s worries. They face an almighty task to escape relegation, made all the harder when Martin linked up with Russell to score. \u2018The difference with him and without him shows you what a top striker can do,\u2019 Mackay rued. Chris Martin celebrates after giving Derby the lead in the crucial promotion clash . Grant saves at the feet of Leon Clarke as relegation-threatened Wigan press for a second-half equaliser . It\u2019s 20 for the season now and how they have missed the Scotland international\u2019s presence. He came on with purpose, knocked the normally immovable Maguire from pillar to post and gave the Rams a focus. Ince just poked over the bar after super build-up involving Martin and Bent, before the on-loan Aston Villa striker wrapped up the points after 81 minutes. Bent comes alive in the 18-yard box and reacted quickest to Jason Pearce\u2019s terrible mix-up to add a second. Wigan did have their chances. McClean was smothered brilliantly by Grant as the Ireland international looked to equalise; William Kvist then saw a half-volley superbly blocked by Hughes. They displayed guts, but not an awful lot of quality, and a first season below the top two divisions since 2003 looks to be the legacy created by Dave Whelan in controversially appointing Mackay. \u2018We want Malky out,\u2019 was the summation of 10,000 home fans.

Arsene Wenger's side were far from their best, but Aaron Ramsey's early goal put them ahead and Burnley, for all their endeavour, didn't create too many clear-cut chances. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Burnley . Tom Heaton: Saved well from Ozil in the build-up to Arsenal\u2019s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear. 7 . Kieran Trippier: Forced Ospina into a good save with a curling free-kick and delivered well from corners. 6 . Jason Shackell: At fault for Arsenal\u2019s opener as his sloppy pass gave possession away cheaply. 5.5 . Michael Duff: The 37-year-old did a good job of keeping Giroud under wraps and provided a threat from corners. 6.5 . Ben Mee: Made a superb block to deny Ramsey a second after a brilliant lobbed pass from Ozil. 7 . Ben Mee was booked in the first half for a blatant block on Aaron Ramsey, but responded well . Michael Duff goes up to challenge Arsenal's in-form striker Olivier Giroud during the hard-fought encounter . George Boyd: Full of running as ever but failed to trouble Arsenal when in possession of the ball. 6 . Scott Arfield: Another full of industry and almost provided an assist for Ings with a clever lob. 6 . David Jones: Brought calmness and quality to Burnley\u2019s midfield but could not find a killer pass. 6.5 . Ashley Barnes: Wide left is not his favoured position but put Bellerin under pressure with and intense work ethic. 6 . Danny Ings: Starved action but went close with an acrobatic effort from Arfield\u2019s chip into the box. 6 . Sam Vokes: Saw an early chance go begging when he fired at Ospina from close range. 6 . Subs: Taylor (for David Jones) 90 . George Boyd, who missed a great chance for Burnley on the half-volley, tackles Francis Coquelin . Scott Arfield tries to get to grips with Mesut Ozil as Burnley worked exceptionally hard against Arsenal . Arsenal . David Ospina: Was perhaps busier than he might have expected and had to make decent saves to deny Vokes and Trippier. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Faded after a bright start. Pinned back by Barnes\u2019 aggressive closing down. Nutmegged by Mee. 6 . Laurent Koscielny: Kept a close eye on Danny Ings and restricted the Burnley top-scorer to just one chance. 7 . Per Mertesacker: Given a good, physical battle by Vokes and just about came out on top. 7 . Hector Bellerin is chopped down by Ashley Barnes as Burnley targeted the young Spanish full back . Laurent Koscielny suffered a few difficult moments as Arsenal sought to continue their excellent form . Nacho Monreal: Made a vital interception and clearance to thwart a chance for Ings. 6 . Francis Coquelin: Has developed into a key member of Arsenal\u2019s midfield and did another fine job as the anchor man.7.5 . Mesut Ozil: Less effective than he was against Liverpool, with only flashes of brilliance. 6 . Aaron Ramsey: Applied the finishing touch after a goalmouth scramble to get the Gunners noses in front. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey fires home to put Arsenal ahead despite several Burnley defenders' best efforts . Santi Cazorla: Left his shooting boots in north London. The Spaniard whipped a free-kick narrowly wide and sent an ambitious left-foot volley over the bar. 6 . Alexis Sanchez: Saw plenty of the ball in the wide left channel but Burnley coped well to nullify the Chilean\u2019s threat. 6 . Olivier Giroud: Marked out of the game by Burnley\u2019s centre-backs and hardly had a kick before being replaced. 5 . Subs: Welbeck for Giroud (81), Chambers for Sanchez (90) Referee: Mike Dean 6.5 . Alexis Sanchez appeals for a free kick in a game where Burnley's tough tackling caused him some problems .

Martin Demichelis 6 . Rightly booked for a hefty challenge on Glenn Murray . Gael Clichy 5.5 . He and Sagna struggled to deal with the pace of Bolasie and Zaha and offered little in attack. Jesus Navas 5 . Another game where too many of his passes routinely went astray and replaced by Nasri before the Toure goal. Will have to reassess his pre-match comment that City were still title contenders. Fernandinho 6 . Made a senseless and unnecessary challenge on Glenn Murray to give away the free kick which led to the second goal. City midfielder Fernandinho failed to sparkle at Selhurst Park . Yaya Toure 7 . Was quiet in the opening half and twice prompted wolf whistles with his shots high into the stands at Selhurst Park but his goal was an absolute scorcher. David Silva 7.5 . City\u2019s best man, hungry for the ball and characteristically intelligent passing. Forced a couple of saves from Speroni in the first half. Edin Dzeko 5 . A quiet game for the striker who seemed furious at his manager at being replaced by Lampard after 66 minutes but surely he could have no complaints? The pressure is mounting on Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini . Sergio Aguero 6 . Expert at finding space in a crowded penalty box and hit the post in the first half, just could not find a way through a steadfast Palace defence. Subs . Lampard 66 - 5.5, Nasri 77 and\u00a0Milner 88. Manager . Manuel Pellegrini 5 . Manchester\u2019s premier home removal firms might look to clear some space in their diary around the end of May because surely his time at the Etihad is limited. Referee . Michael Oliver 5.5 . A mixed game for the youngest referee in the Barclay\u2019s Premier League. He does not lack cojones, backing up his linesman who was probably right to rule Scott Dann and Glenn Murray onside for the goal and dealt well with the excessive protestations of City players.

That hasn\u2019t always been the case during the Spaniard\u2019s debut season at Old Trafford. Between October 20 and February 17, Herrera was barely sighted and started just three of the 21 games Manchester United played in that period, prompting much chatter about his place in the squad. It is no secret David Moyes wanted to bring Herrera to Old Trafford on deadline day in August 2013 but red tape scuppered his ambitions; United pressed ahead with transfer after Moyes was jettisoned but his inactivity prompted questions: Did Louis van Gaal want him or rate him? Ander Herrera, pictured with Juan Mata, netted a brace to ensure his side claimed the win against Aston Villa . Herrera has established himself in Louis van Gaal's first team plans after missing out in previous months . Antonio Valencia (right) congratulates two-goal hero Herrera (centre) after the final whistle . The settling in process was not easy but the 25-year-old\u2019s head has never dropped and in the interview with the club publication, Herrera made it clear that a lack of action was never going to leave him at loggerheads with Van Gaal. \u2018I am very happy, he said. \u2018Even when I wasn\u2019t playing, I was also happy. I am at Manchester United. I feel really lucky to be here. We have to respect his decision. He wants the best for us, the team and we have to follow him always.\u2019 Herrera\u2019s commitment was amply rewarded against Aston Villa. The brightest spark in a Red jersey, he was certainly in the right place at the right time in the 43rd minute, when sweeping a terrific effort past Brad Guzan to set United on their way. His passing was slick, his movement was clever and it was appropriate he bookended this victory with United\u2019s third in injury time; it was fifth shot on target in the Barclays Premier League and, amazingly, his fifth goal. No wonder he left with acclaim from his manager ringing in his ears. \u2018I knew Ander has a touch of class,\u2019 said Van Gaal. \u2018Sometimes he was not composed at the right moment but now he has composure.

However, you might be more surprised to see shot glasses emblazoned with David Cameron's face, UKIP pendents and even party leader underwear appearing on shelves. This year's election has bought with it a bizarre batch of merchandise in a bid to sway the nation. Scroll down for video . David Cameron is said to have watched Bake Off in the past which could explain these cake cases . Many of the unusual trinkets can be purchased on the official party websites which often include a 'gift' category, should you want to bring politics into their special day. Perhaps dad might like an SNP decanter for his wine, or mum could bake in her new set of Conservative cupcake cases, while Ukip have focused on a more wearable range of accessories. We're not entirely sure that any of these will fly off the shelves but here we round up the weirdest official - and unofficial -  collectibles as we prepare to go to the polls. CONSERVATIVE CUPCAKE CASES . David Cameron has previously revealed that he has watched The Great British Bake Off, which might explain these rather pricey cupcake cases. The pack of 36 patriotic cases, in Tory blue with a Union Jack design, comes in at \u00a35 a pop. UKIP PENDANT . We know it isn't advisable to wear your heart on your sleeve but what about your political opinion around your neck? This Cornish Pewter pendant is available from the party's store for \u00a312 and is described as an 'ideal gift for Ukip enthusiasts'. Political party underwear insures that politicians remain the butt of the joke . LEADER UNDERWEAR . Political leaders are used to being the butt of the jokes, and one retailer has taken this a step further. Twisted Tee, has created a range of 'political man pants' - capacious white garments printed with the faces of the party leaders. The pair of Nick Clegg undies are described in ironic terms: 'Hand printed gingerly in London on to 100 per cent white cotton Y front. 'For men who don't quite know whether they dress to the right or left.' DAVID CAMERON SHOT GLASS . The David Cameron shot glass is one way of getting you through the lengthy process . A set of David Cameron shot glasses could be the perfect excuse for a general election drinking game. Now CafePress is offering the custom ceramic vessels emblazoned with the Prime Minister's picture for \u00a311 each. Knock back a shot for every time he says 'hard working people' however, and you may find yourself needing to make cuts of your own. LIBERAL DEMOCRATS 18TH BIRTHDAY CARDS . Keen to snap up new voters the minute they become of age, the Lib Dems have created their own 18th birthday cards. The plain cards simply say, 'Wishing You a Happy Birthday' above the figure '18' written out in blue and filled with the party's yellow bird logo. If anyone knows a large number of 17-year-olds with birthdays looming, the party's official store offers the cards in packs of 100 for \u00a334. SNP PICNIC BLANKET . The SNP picnic blanket is the ideal way to showcase your political opinion in the great outdoors . The SNP, with a revitalised Nicola Sturgeon at the helm, are dedicated to getting their message out there. So dedicated in fact that they are not prepared to miss a single opportunity to spread the word. The foldaway tartan picnic rug allows you to air your political views in the great outdoors for the price of \u00a345. SNP HIGH VIZ JACKET . The SNP aren't missing a trick when it comes to merchandising. With this handy high viz vest you can showcase your political orientation with pride in all hazardous situations and for the meagre price of \u00a38. The e-cigarette liquid comes in five flavours one for each of these leaders . ELECTION E-CIGARETTE FLAVOURS . In a bizarre addition to the already unusual election memorabilia being sold, Totally Wicked's Red Label has produced five e-cigarette liquids pairing with five of the party leaders. Varieties include Cameron's Eton Mess, a strawberry and meringue flavour inspired by the PM's old school. Miliband's Rocky Red is based on the seaside treat of teeth-cracking rock as 'being leader of the opposition is often described as the worst job in British politics, so where better to escape to for a break than the great British seaside, famous not just for being a great holiday destination but also for hosting many party political conferences.' For an e-cigarette inspired by Nigel Farage, the site says: 'We all know Nigel Farage likes his ciggies and a pint, now it turns out he is also a vaper! So we've made this e-liquid especially for him. A full tobacco flavour with a dash of beer, topped with a note of espresso.' The official Conservative shop is selling baby clothes meaning they can start their opinions early . MINI THATCHER BABY CLOTHES . Many parents are known to push their views on to their offspring and in this case they're starting early. The official Conservative website stocks baby clothes including Babygros and bibs with Little Iron Lady (Margaret Thatcher's famous nickname printed on the front.) Baby's first election might be more appropriate. You can now own Nick Clegg's apology on MP3 with proceeds going towards a children's charity . NICK CLEGG, I'M SORRY- THE SINGLE . Re-live Nick Clegg's apology over the Liberal Democrats' climbdown on tuition fees in full auto-tune glory with this MP3 edition with an album cover mocked up to resemble The Clash's seminal album, London Calling. Available to buy for \u00a30.99, the proceeds go towards The Children's Hospital Charity. SNP DECANTER . It appears that the SNP area about ready to brand just about anything. This crystal decanter engraved with 'Scottish N Proud' would make an excellent novelty gift during the election. With a \u00a375 price tag, however, it may make an awkward heirloom if the SNP aren't elected. But on election night itself, what better way to pass the time as the votes are counted. UKIP LADIES SILK SCARF . Want an elegant way to showcase your support for Nigel Farage and his party? Look no further than Ukip's silk 'pound' logo printed on a pale, sheer scarf. The party's website assures that it is a 'delicate chiffon' in a 'gentle lilac' so as to avoid being too ostentatious. And although it may feature a pound sign pattern, it is a thrifty purchase coming in at \u00a33. The UKIP silk scarf is supposed to be the sophisticated way of showing your support for the party . These life sized cardboard cutouts make a great addition to the office...apparently . PARTY LEADER CARDBOARD CUT-OUT . Some might say there's not much difference between our biggest political figures and these cardboard cut-outs. Fortunately we can find out for ourselves as the  free-standing Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg figures are available at Amazon for \u00a329.99. For those of you unsure of what you would do with a life size political leader, the website provides the following suggestions: 'Suitable for gifts, bedroom decoration, home theatre decoration, wall decoration, kid's bedrooms, office desks and parties.' Choc on Choc have decorated their latest offerings with Nick (left) Ed (centre) and David (right) PARTY LEADER CONFECTIONARY . Choc on Choc have embellished their artisan chocolates with a rather unusual decoration: the faces of three of the party leaders. David Cameron\u2019s bar is studded with blueberry pieces, Ed Miliband\u2019s comes in a red raspberry flavour and the Nick Clegg edition is filled with chunks of honeycomb. SNP TEA LIGHT HOLDER . The SNP tea-light holder literally allows you to hold a candle to Nicola Sturgeon . What better way to hold a candle to your favourite party than with an actual candle. It's less ostentatious than some other SNP souvenirs but it still has a certain glow... for \u00a315 a holder. UKIP DOG T-SHIRT . We're assuming this is for a canine who is not a Farage fan judging by the gesture on the reverse, but last time we checked dogs can't vote anyway. But if you wish to cause a stir in the park opt for this \u00a317.95 tee from Zazzle.", "candidate": "The 2015 general election is just over two weeks away.

It takes a range of types to make a successful team and you could not get more contrasting personalities than Sir Ian and the quiet lad from Burnley who broke his English Test wicket-taking record on Friday night. When I played for England we had Alec Stewart, meticulous and well organised, opening the batting with that scruffy herbert Mike Atherton. Jimmy Anderson celebrates taking a record 384th Test wicket for England against the West Indies on Friday . The 32-year-old is congratulated by his England team-mates following the dismissal of Denesh Ramdin . Then we had Andrew Caddick, who needed reassurance and an arm round the shoulder, opening the bowling with a character in Darren Gough who loved the limelight and wanted to be the centre of attention. Botham was always larger than life and in your face, had huge self-belief as a player and still has an aura about him now. When Sir Ian walks into a room everybody notices him. Anderson, by contrast, would go unnoticed if he walked into a room. He shuns the limelight \u2014 so unlike the angry youth we so often see on the field. Sir Ian Botham watches on and applauds as Anderson beats the former England cricketer's Test record . Botham gives two thumbs up as he watches the action unfold during the Test match in Antigua . The quality they do share is their stubbornness. I have never heard Beefy admit he was wrong about anything. The only smidgeon of self-doubt came when admitting he perhaps shouldn\u2019t have taken on the West Indies so often with the hook. That absolute belief that he is right about everything was what made Botham the cricketer he was. Jimmy, too, knows the way he wants to do things and doesn\u2019t like to be told to do it any other way. He had a bit of an argument with Alastair Cook on the fourth evening of this Test. Cook wanted to keep the slips in but Anderson has been worried about batsmen rotating the strike and taking singles his whole career and wanted the chance to go at certain players for the whole of an over. Botham will be very happy for Anderson He is not one of those former players who look at records and hope they stay at the top of the tree. The 59-year-old was one of the first people to congratulate Anderson after the Test match had finished . Cook had to remind the leader of his attack that England had more than 400 to play with and needed to attack so the captain got his way, even though Anderson looked grumpy about it. The point is, you do not have to have the same rules for every player in your team. There really can be one rule for Sir Ian Botham and there can be a different rule for Jimmy Anderson. Jimmy Anderson was one of the nicest blokes I captained and I was delighted when he broke Sir Ian\u2019s record here. You could see how much it meant to the England team, too, who were urging him towards this landmark. Botham, up in the commentary box with us, was very happy for Anderson. He has been waiting to give Jimmy some wine and now he will hand it over gladly. Botham has always been larger than life and showed huge self-belief as a player and he still has an aura . England's Alastair Cook takes the catch as Anderson celebrates taking his record-breaking wicket .

It all started with a birthday party that little Damani Terry was attending. During the family gathering, he dashed out into the street and was struck and killed by a GMC van, according to Milwaukee police. The distraught driver, Archie Brown Jr., 40, immediately stopped and got out to tend to the boy. But it was too late, police said. Damani was dead. Damani's alarmed family came running, including his older brother, 15-year-old Rasheed Chiles, police said. That was not the end of the situation. Soon, two more people would also die: the driver and the teen were both felled by bullets fired by the same man, police said. That man, identified as Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, was located late Wednesday at a Chicago-area hotel. He committed suicide as authorities closed in with a warrant for his arrest, Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn told reporters. \"Chicago police and United States Marshals Service entered the hotel room, whereupon Mr. Chiles took his own life with his firearm,\" the police chief said Thursday. An accidental death, a fatal retaliation rips apart two families . Damani's family members had previously identified the shooting suspect as the boys' uncle. \"Sunday was the worst day I ever lived in my whole entire life,\" Lena Tidwell, told CNN affiliate WISN. \"It's a day I wish had never, never came.\" Tidwell is the boys' grandmother and the mother of the alleged gunman. She said she was inside eating cake and ice cream at the birthday when her life turned upside down. \"I didn't know my grandbaby got hit, and then I heard people just screaming,\" she said. \"Then I just heard gunshots, and my daughter ran in the house with the baby in her arms.\" The family believes the uncle targeted Brown, and Rasheed was struck by an errant bullet. \"I heard he was trying to pick his brother up. He was trying to hold him and save him,\" a family friend, Stephanie Townsend, told CNN affiliate WITI.
